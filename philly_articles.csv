$3.5 billion Schuylkill Yards breaks ground on future park,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/8/16622906/schuylkill-yards-groundbreaking,article,"It’s really happening: Drexel University and Brandywine Realty Trust just broke ground on their ambitious $3.5 billion Schuylkill Yards project, about 18 months after they first announced their plans to transform 14 acres in University City into a leading innovation hub. “At its core, Schuylkill Yards is centered around interaction, a place that encourages living, walking, collaboration, and fun,” said Brandywine Realty Trust’s CEO Jerry Sweeney. “What better way to embrace those ideas than by creating a park?”The groundbreaking took place Wednesday morning at 3001 Market Street, which will be the site of the future 1.3-acre Drexel Square, an elliptical park designed by Shop Architects and West 8. The green space will replace what’s currently a parking lot across the street from 30th Street Station. Sweeney described the park as a both a “launching pad” and “centerpiece” for the innovation-driven neighborhood. Along with a more than 12,000-square-foot elliptical green lawn, there will be custom-made granite benches, outdoor furniture, lighting, and raised planter beds filled with shrubs and perennials. But perhaps the most striking feature will be the 30 soaring Dawn Redwood trees, which will be planted at more than 25 feet tall. The park will open in fall 2018. In total, there are 6.5 acres of planned green space and street improvements throughout Schuylkill Yards. Of course, the park just the start of Schuylkill Yards. The mega-development’s 15- to 20-year master plan calls for the buildout of new towers, totaling 6.9 million square feet in new construction. Currently, city approvals are in place for 1.3 million square feet of new development and the revamp of the Bulletin Building. The first phase will include the buildout of the park, as well as 4.6 acres of residential, office, research, and retail development. Sweeney said that early next year, amid the park construction, the team will begin the revamp of the Bulletin Building and begin plans for the mixed-use towers. The ceremonial construction start also happens to come just weeks after Philly submitted its proposal to bring Amazon’s second headquarters here. The city’s pitch included Schuylkill Yards as one of the three potential sites where the e-commerce giant could build its $5 billion headquarters. “If we are lucky,” said Drexel University president John Fry, “Drexel Square may one day soon be a gathering spot for thousands and thousands of Amazon employees.”"
"Design committee OKs Schuylkill River towers, West Philly transit-oriented project",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/8/16618724/civic-design-review-recap-river-walk-towers-new-market-west,article,"At Tuesday’s monthly Civic Design Review meeting, two of the three projects were given the green light by the committee, while another student housing development was asked to make some changes and return for a second presentation at the end of the month. A two-tower project by PMC Property Group proposed for one of the last-remaining developable sites along the Schuylkill River was one of the two projects that concluded their Civic Design Review process. However, this was the project’s second time presenting to the committee, and so the process would have concluded anyway, regardless of the outcome.At last month’s initial presentation, the Civic Design Review committee called the design proposal a “bitter pill to swallow,” critiquing the project’s lack of integration with surrounding neighborhood and Schuylkill River Trail. At the same time, they praised Gensler’s designs. In total, the committee had 18 recommendations and concerns about the project, including the above-ground podium parking. Of the 18 suggestions, two were addressed in the revised design proposal: The bike path leading to the Schuylkill River Trail was widened and a brick facade along Arch Street was replaced with shopfront glazing to match the lobby’s facade. Much to the committee’s disappointment, a Gensler architect was not present at Tuesday’s second presentation. The developer believed that revised design proposal “spoke for itself.” A representative for PMC said that they plan to continue workshopping the design with the Logan Square Neighborhood Association. Dubbed New Market West, this design proposal calls for a 145,019-square-foot mixed-use development at what’s currently a parking lot, vacant rowhomes, and unused gas station at the foot of the Market-Frankford El. The Mission First Housing, transit-oriented development would bring a five-story building with commercial space in the first phase and 35 low-income housing units in the second phase. It also calls for 80 parking spaces in an underground garage, a public promenade, and a roof park, similar to Cira Green in University City. The committee praised the project overall and voted to conclude the CDR process for the $13.5 million project. “It’s great to see a project that has ground-floor retail, underground parking, and a third-party LEED certification,” said chair and architect Nancy Rogo-Trainer. “And it’s nice to see that [these projects] can be done and that development groups are willing to invest in them.” The committee also considered a proposal to build a six-story prefab apartment building at 4125 Chestnut Street, which is currently home to a carwash and a parking lot. The site, which is zoned CMX-4, would allow for a much taller building (a 17-story tower was originally proposed), but the proposal instead calls for a mid-rise with ground-floor retail, 130 apartments, and underground parking with 27 spaces. In addition, there will be a roof deck with a dog run and three or four parklets on each corner of the building. The committee voted to continue the CDR process to allow the design team to address some major concerns, like the one elevator for 130 units. The developer and designer will have a quick turn-around—the next CDR meeting is scheduled for November 28. "
15 condos coming to tiny Graduate Hospital block,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/7/16617836/graduate-hospital-homes-for-sale-ravello-philly,article,"By the end of this year, a small side street in Graduate Hospital will look mighty different, with a new condo project currently under construction to replace a series of two-story rowhomes.  Ravello Philly is the latest Graduate Hospital project of developers Noah Ostroff, Michael Murray, and Harvey Ostroff. It will bring 15 luxury condos to the tiny side street of 1430-38 Clymer Street, which is just a block from Broad Street. Six rowhomes were razed to make way for the development. “This was a unique opportunity for us to buy up most of the block in one of the hottest neighborhoods in Philadelphia,” Ostroff said in an e-mail to Curbed Philly. Ostroff’s team is also behind the ongoing project at nearby 17th and Bainbridge, which will bring 16 condos to the former site of New Light Beulah Baptist Church. The development will include five three-unit buildings with dark brick facades in front and aluminum paneling in the back. In total, there will be 10 three-bedroom, bi-level units clocking in at about 1,800 square feet. There will be another five one-bedroom units about half that size. Each unit will have outdoor space, too. Expect finishes and features like Nest thermostats, hardwood floors, Shaker cabinetry, and big soaking tubs. Ostroff says the asking prices are still being finalized, but project should be finished by the end of the year. Stay tuned. "
Phillys new online Atlas tool compiles all property data into one place,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/7/16617296/philadelphia-properties-land-vacant-lot-atlas-map-tool,article,"Searching for homes and vacant lots in Philly is about to get a whole lot easier with the launch of Atlas, a new online mapping tool that pools nearly every bit of information about one property into one place. It’s a big and helpful step for the city’s open data initiative and everyday users who run the gamut from developers to historic preservationists “to anyone in community groups who want to understand what’s happening in their neighborhoods,” says Mark Wheeler, Philadelphia's chief geographic information officer and deputy CIO for Enterprise Data and Architecture. Until now, this process hasn’t been easy for folks wanting to look up a property’s zoning appeals, crime statistics, or deed information. Says Wheeler, “Depending on the question you’re asking related to what’s happening at an address, you could use six apps, you could use up to a dozen applications.”Atlas now compiles everything one needs to know about a single address into one comprehensive database, including deed information, permits, 311 data, crime statistics, zoning appeals, and the registered community organization (RCO) that’s associated with that property. It also includes historic imagery of the site, dating as far back as 1860. Atlas is the brainchild of the Office of Innovation and Technology, a city department that has been leading efforts to promote Philly’s open data and Smart City initiatives. Creating this tool first made the most sense to the city, since research shows that approximately 90 percent of city data has a location component, says Wheeler. Plus, the office found that a majority of users come to city websites looking for property data. In 2014, the department started realizing that the city could use an all-in-one-tool, and the Atlas team spent the last year creating the tool. Furthermore, it’s designed as a framework that any city department will be able to use on their own site. CleanPHL.org, for example, has already adopted the tool on its on site. The property data will be updated as regularly as possible, says Wheeler, though it could range anywhere from two days to a week depending on what city department is responsible for the data. 311 information would likely be updated more instantly than, say, property sales. Atlas officially launches next week at the website atlas.phila.gov. On Tuesday, November 14 there will be an open house at the Municipal Services Building (1401 John F. Kennedy Boulevard) from 5 to 7 p.m., where the public can learn how to use the online tool."
Sneak Peek: Inside and above the 34-story Alexander tower,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/6/16598886/alexander-apartments-philadelphia-photos,article,"For the past two years, the 34-story Alexander tower, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects (RAMSA) and BLT Architects, has been on the rise at 1601 Vine Street. When it finally opens in late January 2018, it will be the tallest residential building in Logan Square, packed with apartments, amenities, and a 12,000-square-foot daycare on the ground floor.But the panoramic views are what really make the tower stand out—and there is no shortage of terraces to take advantage of them. The Alexander, named after the famed local sculptor Alexander Calder who created the William Penn statue atop City Hill, broke ground in 2015 and has been on the rise ever since, through the completion of the Mormon Temple across the street. Property Reserve, Inc. (PRI), a subsidiary of the Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints, is the owner of the Alexander. To be clear, the 483,000-square-foot tower is still very much a construction zone. But on a recent tour of the property, work was moving along at a fast clip in preparation of the January 22 deadline. Unlike other developments, where residents often tend to move in amid construction, all 277 units at the Alexander will be finished and ready for occupancy by January. The nearly 300 units are a mix of apartments and townhouses—both rentals. There are studios, one-bedroom, two-bedroom apartments ranging from $1,675 to $5,920 a month. Meanwhile, the 13 townhomes range from $3,620 for a three-bedroom to $5,900 for a four-bedroom. Each have private entries, one off Vine Street and another from the three-story underground parking garage.  “Variety is all over this place,” says construction project manager Craig Homer, who has overseen the buildout of the Alexander’s 51 different floor plans. Leasing only just started, and five apartments had been rented at the time of publication. The townhouses in particular seem to have attracted empty nesters and families, says community manager Tracy Keyser.“We’re getting a little bit of everybody. But with these townhomes, it’s really been empty nesters who are selling their big homes in the suburbs and moving into the city,” says Keyser. “They come in and they say, ‘We just want to live care-free in retirement.’” That shouldn’t be a problem. Like most new developments going up throughout Philly, the Alexander comes with a long list of amenities. There’s the amenity level on the second floor with an outdoor terrace with built-in grills and an indoor lap pool. The gym is on this level, too, with 20-plus-foot-tall ceilings. There are 300 parking spaces in the three-story parking garage—more than enough for each unit—and bike storage spaces on every level, too. And, because no apartment tower is complete these days without pet amenities, says Keyser, there will be dog wash on site, too. Perhaps what sets the Alexander apart from other high-rises, though, is its plethora of private outdoor space. Nearly all of the townhouses and more than half of the apartments in the tower have either back patios, balconies, or wrap-around terraces. The crème de la crème of all of the apartments can be found on the 32nd floor, where there are four penthouse units, each with a private terrace. A corner unit on this floor features large windows—even the soaking tub in the master bathrooms has views of Logan Square far down below. That unit comes with a hefty rental price tag: $5,185 a month. Still, the views aren’t only reserved for future penthouse dwellers. On the very top of the building on the 34th floor, there will be an observation deck available to all residents. “We’re isolated from downtown, not trapped in our views,” says Homer. The Alexander is leasing now and scheduled to open in late January. "
$600M Live! Casino and Hotel Philadelphia to start construction in 2018,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/3/16602166/south-philly-casino-construction-date-2018,article,"A casino and hotel project that’s long been in the works has cleared its latest legal hurdle, meaning the project could begin construction in South Philly as early as next year. Live! Casino and Hotel Philadelphia, proposed for South Philly near all of the stadiums, is partially owned by Watche ""Bob"" Manoukian, who also owns a casino in Bensalem. But until Thursday, Pennsylvania had an ownership restriction on casinos that prohibited owners from having stake in more than one casino.Local would-be competitor SugarHouse Casino had filed an appeal against Live! Casino and Hotel Philadelphia, challenging the ownership. But on Thursday, Governor Tom Wolf repealed the 2004 ownership restriction, thereby making SugarHouse’s appeal moot. SugarHouse then dropped its appeal. With the repeal, investor David S. Cordish, chairman and CEO of Cordish Cos. of Baltimore, told the Inquirer that construction on the $600 million casino and hotel will begin in 2018. If all goes to plan, Live! Casino and Hotel Philadelphia should open its doors in 2020. The casino calls for 2,000 slot machines and 125 game tables, while the hotel will have 200-plus rooms. There will also be a 2,600-square-foot parking garage attached to the project. It’s touting itself as, “the first comprehensive gaming, resort, entertainment and sports destination in the United States.” "
Bohlin Cywinski Jackson to design another Penn college house,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/3/16598996/university-of-pennsylvania-new-college-house-west,article,"Fresh off its completion of the New College House, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson will design the next dorm for Penn’s campus, New College House West. Penn announced Thursday that the university’s board of trustees has approved the design firm’s plans for a $163 million college house at 40th Street, Walnut Street, and Locust Walk. It will be adjacent to the West Philadelphia branch of the Free Library. Penn president Amy Gutman said New College House West will serve as a western gateway to the campus, as well as help house more students on campus. “New College House West will enable more Penn students to participate in the College House system, and it will also give us the capacity and flexibility to continue renovating existing student housing.”Penn’s college house system is unique in that it houses both undergrads, graduate students, and faculty in one community. It currently has 12 college houses, with the New College House being its most recent project built from the ground up. The university also reopened this fall the Hill College House, designed by Eero Saarinen, after it underwent a $80 million renovation. Bohlin Cywinski Jackson’s design harkens to its New College House, and it will also aim for LEED Silver certification. The 250,000-square-foot building will feature a north tower on Walnut, with two shorter wings to the east and west of it that reach Locust Walk.The New College House West will be a three-year college house with 450 beds for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. There will be six- and five-bedroom, two-bath suites, and four-, three-, and two-bedroom, one-bath suites. And like the other college houses, there will be collaborative spaces like study rooms, lounges, and music rooms.  The goal is to break ground in spring 2018 and open in fall 2021. "
Report: More than 400 human skeletons unearthed at Old City construction site,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/31/16580362/old-city-graveyard-coffins-218-arch-street,article,"Last March, construction at 218 Arch Street in Old City came to a startling halt when multiple coffins were unearthed at the site. It was estimated that there were potentially dozens more buried deep below. Try hundreds. A new, official report says that bones from 407 human skeletons from the 19th century have been found at the construction site. That includes 328 people and 79 graves, according to the Inquirer. The report was filed by AECOM last week to Orphans Court, which has jurisdiction over abandoned graveyards. The officially tally comes about a year after developer PMC Property Group first discovered human remains at the site, which turned out to be part of the First Baptist Church Burial Ground, established in 1707 as one of the first cemeteries in the city.Although PMC alerted various city departments about the bones, each agency said it lacked jurisdiction in this particular matter, so construction simply continued. But construction workers kept unearthing more bones, so in March the developer called in archeological experts who started transporting the remains to Rutgers-Camden for study. Orphans Court then got involved. After study, preservation, and potential identification, the human remains will be reinterred at Mt. Moriah Cemetery, no later than August 2020. 218 Arch Street was most recently a surface parking lot and shares the street with Little Boy’s Court, one of the oldest cobblestone streets in the city. PMC plans to build a 10-story, 180,000-square-foot apartment building with 116 residential units."
Demo permits filed as Wills Eye Hospital eyes expansion,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/26/16547238/wills-eye-hospital-expansion-philadelphia,article,"Wills Eye Hospital in Washington Square West is moving forward with plans to expand its campus, starting with the planned demolition of two structures on the corner of S. 9th and Locust. “Wills Eye Hospital has been in discussion for several months with representatives from the City about the condition of two non-historic structures, 229 and 231 S. Ninth Street,” hospital spokesperson Cathy Moss told Curbed Philly. “Following these discussions, we have concluded that in the interest of public safety, it is necessary to demolish these two structures.” The two buildings are not registered historic, although they are located next to a series of other rowhomes that are on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. Moss said the hospital has filed a request for demolition permits with the city’s Department of Licenses and Inspections (L&I) and are awaiting approval. A newsletter sent out this week by the Washington Square West Civic Association said, “Present thinking is a new tower on the east side of 9th Street, adjacent to the current hospital and garage, possibly extending to Locust Street.”However, Moss said the hospital hasn’t made any final decisions about future development on the site, though it is clear that it will be a new research and medical-care facility. Said Moss, “There remains a critical need to expand the hospital’s facilities so that we can continue to provide world-class care to our patients.” "
"Philadelphia 2030 District launches to cut energy use, transportation emissions by half",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/26/16552444/philadelphia-2030-district-launch-energy-transportation-reduction,article,"In Philly’s latest move to combat climate change, it has announced the launch of the Philadelphia 2030 District. It’s a voluntary private initiative spearheaded by the Delaware Valley Green Building Council that brings together property owners, managers, utility companies, and community organizations who want to stem the effects of global warming. How so? By pledging to reduce their energy and water use and transportation emissions by 50 percent by the year 2030.  “Really, this impacts everyone because unless we can get a handle on carbon emissions, and seriously reduce them, climate change is going to have an impact on the whole city and the world,” said Alex Dews, executive director of the DVGBC. The district is currently limited to University City and Center City, where there is a large concentration of buildings that tend to be the biggest energy consumers in the city, although Dews says there are plans to expand the area down the road. The average commercial building in Philly wastes 30 percent of its energy, while 60 percent of carbon emissions are produced by the building sector.“The reason we’re focused on the largest buildings is because they’re by far the largest energy users,” says Dews, “and small changes in large buildings yield really big results.” Some organizations including SEPTA and Drexel, as well as the City of Philadelphia, have already signed onto the 2030 commitment. Developer Brandywine Realty Trust also committed to the pledge early on; a number of its new buildings, including the FMC Tower and Cira Centre fall within the district and include not just commercial developments, but also residential properties. Each year, the DVGBC will release an annual progress report to see if companies and organizations are meeting their pledged goals. Philly is now among 18 cities in the country to commit to this national initiative known as Architecture 2030, with 15 million square feet committed to the pledge. Dews hopes that number expands now that the program has officially launched; there is a total of 120 million square feet of properties within the district that could commit to the pledge, he says. The commitment of private organizations and companies to energy reduction is the latest in a series of recent city efforts to combat climate change. Last month, the city released its own Philadelphia Municipal Energy Master Plan, a multi-step roadmap to reduce energy use and clean the city’s energy supply. It also has a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the city’s buildings in half by 2030. Earlier this summer, Kenney signed onto the Mayors for 100% Clean Energy effort spearheaded by the Sierra Club. The commitment for Philly to transition to 100 percent renewable energy came on the heels of the White House’s move to reject the Paris climate accord.Of the Philadelphia 2030 District, Kenney said, “We’re really happy to be a part of this effort. With the federal government abdicating responsibility to a sustainable planet and denying climate change, we as cities need to lead.” "
Archdiocese issues RFQ for Logan Square mixed-use campus,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/25/16542766/philadelphia-archdiocese-cathedral-highrise-towers,article,"A year after announcing plans to build two high-rises by its historic Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia has issued its first Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for developers interested in taking on the Cathedral Block Redevelopment. The archdiocese dropped the RFQ on Monday, stating, “It is anticipated that several developers will participate in the RFQ process and that the project will be put out to bid in early 2018.”The move comes after the archdiocese first released renderings to the Logan Square Neighborhood Association in October 2016 of the proposed project. They illustrated two high rise towers, mixed residential and retail space, gardens, and walkways.Meanwhile, three buildings currently on the site would potentially be demolished, leaving an L-shaped, 2.32-acre piece of land to be redeveloped:  The Archdiocesan Pastoral Center (built in 1969), the Holy Family Center (built in 1960), and the former convent for the Cathedral (built in 1957).The historic Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul would remain. The mixed-use project is an effort for the archdiocese to boost its finances. The parcel of land in the heart of Logan Square and along the Ben Franklin Parkway places the future project in a prime location that has already seen a major investment from other development projects. Nearby is the Alexander residential tower, which is nearing completion, and a collection of mega-townhomes also right on the square are currently on the market. "
18-story tower on North Broad next to Blue Horizon breaks ground,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/25/16542926/1324-north-broad-temple-groundbreaking,article,"Construction has finally begun on a new 18-story tower on North Broad next to the Blue Horizon boxing venue, nearly a year after plans for the project were first announced. Local developer Bock Development Group just broke ground on what’s being called “The Nest,” an 18-story residential tower at 1324 N. Broad Street. Designed by Cecil Baker + Partners, the high-rise will include 192 fully-furnished residential units and retail on the first floor. The second floor will be the tower’s amenity level, with study lounges, a tech center, a gym, and a terrace. The project’s stats have changed slightly since last year, when plans called for a 17-story tower and 180 apartments. Although the tower will now include one more story, it will remain the same height. A one-story structure was razed last year to make way for the metal and glass tower. “This building is designed as a beacon of the future that pays deference to the structures of North Broad’s storied past,” said Chris Blakelock, a partner at Cecil Baker + Partners. Indeed, the new building will be neighbors to the historic Blue Horizon boxing venue and the New Freedom Theatre, whose Edwin Forrest house is also for sale. In fact, brownstone piers will be installed to separate the ground-floor retail entrance from the residential lobby as a nod to the New Freedom Theatre next door. If all goes to plan, construction, led by Ernest Bock and Sons, should finish up in August 2019. "
Post Brothers finishes $100M renovation at Presidential City,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/20/16507432/presidential-city-post-brothers-renovations-complete,article,"It took three years and $100 million, but renovations at Presidential City on the very edge of Philly and Bala Cynwyd are complete. Developer Post Brothers has announced that it has finished its overhaul of the Adams, the fourth and final apartment tower at Presidential City at 3900 City Avenue. With 1,000 apartments total, it marks the completion of what’s the developer says is the largest redevelopment residential project in the city, which Post Brothers began in 2014. All four of the towers are named after U.S. presidents. The original intention of Presidential City’s developer John McShain in 1950 was to build 48 towers that would be named after all of the presidents. He only managed to build the Washington, Madison, Adams, and Jefferson before selling the rest of the land.Post Brothers bought the property on the edge of Philly near Bala Cynwyd in 2012 for $80 million, and began renovations in 2014. At the time, the rentals had suffered from years of neglect and were pretty dated. Now, the studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments feature finishes like sustainable hardwood floors, soaking tubs, and porcelain tile. The units range from $1,000 to $4,500. The heart of the massive apartment complex is the amenity-laden Sora Pool Club. This has been open for more than a year and features three salt-water pools, bocce courts, a gym, and multiple terraces. Although Presidential City is the Post Brothers’ largest redevelopment project to date, the developer has a number of other projects currently underway throughout the city. The redevelopment of the historic Hamilton and six other residential properties is ongoing in University City, and construction continues at the 21-story Atlantic tower on South Broad Street. "
How might Amazons HQ2 impact Philly rents?,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/19/16502908/amazon-second-headquarters-rent-impact-philadelphia,article,"If Amazon picks Philly to build its second headquarters, it could mean colossal changes—both good and bad—for the city, including an influx of an estimated 50,000 new jobs. But with potentially thousands of people moving to Philly, what does that means for rents in Philly, a city that consistently touts its affordability? Rents in the Philadelphia metro will increase an additional 0.6 to 0.8 percent each year with Amazon HQ2, costing a Philly renter up to $6,506 more over the next 10 years, according to a new report released today by Apartment List. Those numbers are on top of the already 3.1 percent average baseline rent growth that Philly has experienced each year from 2005 to 2015. Compared to the 15 other major metros that Apartment List analyzed, a 0.6 to 0.8 percent additional increase places Philly in the “moderately impacted” category. Meanwhile, fellow Pennsylvania city Pittsburgh, also in the running for Amazon HQ2, would experience a much larger rent hike, estimated at 1.2 to 1.6 percent each year. How does Apartment List figure all this? Its researchers analyzed data from the U.S. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics to figure out how much new housing a metro can build, the amount of slack in the housing market, and what the impact would be of such a large influx of high-wage workers. For Philly, the analysis found that with a vacancy of 9.0 percent, Philly is actually pretty well-equipped to handle the 50,000 Amazon employees, if you compare its current stats to other cities. Take San Jose, for example, whose average rent already rose an astonishing 57 percent between 2005 and 2015. It also has the lowest vacancy rate out of all the 15 metros studied. Therefore, the researchers suggest that the Philly metro’s population size and high vacancy rate will prevent any extreme rent increases. But, things aren’t all perfect. The researchers caution that rents will still rise no matter what, “due to the difficulty of building in the metro.” Historically, the metro has issued 10,882 building permits on average each year. That rate would need to increase, says Apartment List, if the metro wants to be able to handle the job growth and new Amazon folks. This finding is in line with a separate report, which found that Philly already isn’t building enough housing—affordable housing, at that—for its projected population growth.Of course, this report does account for potential Amazon employees opting to buy versus rent. Their expected salaries are estimated to be around $100,000 (Philly’s median household income is currently around $41,000) so they could certainly afford a downpayment a one of the homes in Philly’s market. It’s a different story though because although the city’s rental market has a decent vacancy rate, the amount of homes for sale in Philly is at an all-time low. That means with Amazon’s influx of workers, even more people bidding to buy a home. Only, Amazon’s employees would likely be able to afford the increased home prices.

The mayor was at the Barnes Foundation this morning to thank the hundreds of people who played a role in creating the city’s pitch to bring Amazon and its estimated $5 billion headquarters and 50,000 new jobs to Philadelphia. Philly’s official bid establishes itself as being in the ""Goldilocks"" zone for Amazon, or as Mayor Kenney put it, ""Just right."" It proposes three locations in two Philly neighborhoods for Amazon’s second headquarters that should not come as a surprise: University City’s Schuylkill Yards and uCity Square, and the Navy Yard. The trio was chosen because all sites are ready for development. The $1 billion uCity Square’s development in University City is already under construction, and Schuylkill Yards, a $3.5 billion development of Drexel and Brandywine Realty Trust, has permits in hand. Navy Yard has already attracted hundreds of companies to its large site on the Delaware River and continues to expand. The city also launched an immersive website that include the official bid, interactive maps, the three proposed sites, and all of the videos that tout Philly’s livability, talent, and logistics, with cameos from restauranteurs and entrepreneurs to Penn’s president Amy Gutmann to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. More than 200 local business leaders, as well as various community development groups, students, and people from all over the city participated in the creation of the bid. Although the the announcement was made six weeks ago, much of the bid process was squeezed into three weeks, said Marc Coleman of Tactile Group, which developed the website. Amazon first broke the internet a little over a month ago when it announced that it was looking for a new place in North America for its second headquarters. It is currently located in Seattle on a 8.1-million-square-foot campus. The requirements included a location within a North American city and metro area of more than one million people that could attract and retain tech talent. And of course, enough land to build its mega-campus. Philly was one of the first cities to pitch itself as a “prime” location from Amazon HQ2. Over the past few weeks the city put out an open call to residents to help shape its proposal, started a social media campaign called #PhillyDelivers, and finally, published a series of videos in the final days leading up to the October 19 deadline that touted its location, transit systems, talent pool, and livability. Even one of the city’s biggest developments, the 30th Street Station District Plan, was temporarily put on hold due in light of the Amazon news; it’s located next to the Schuylkill Yards.But Philly is in the same boat as a whole bunch of other cities and towns vying for Amazon’s attention. Its closest competitors include Delaware County, Bensalem, Camden, Atlantic City, and Wilmington, Delaware. Pennsylvania in general said it plans to offer more than $1 billion in tax breaks to Amazon if it chooses any city in the state. Still, most recent analyses pit Philly as one of the top contenders for Amazon. Moody’s Analytics, for example, ranked it among the top three metros for HQ2, primarily due to its ideal location on the Eastern seaboard. Kenney said that regardless of whether or not Amazon picks Philly, “I’ve never been more proud of our city and the region.” He said he wants to build off the momentum of the Amazon HQ2 bid and continue meeting with local businesses that “currently call Philadelphia home.” All that’s left is to wait and see. Amazon is not expected to make a decision until next year. "
"The current state of Phillys churches and sacred spaces, in five charts",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/19/16499480/philadelphia-churches-adaptive-reuse-pew-report,article,"It may seem like every other day a church in Philly gets demolished or turned into apartments. But in reality, a mere 10 percent of sacred spaces have been repurposed, and nearly two dozen have been razed, according to a new report. Those are just some of the findings from new report issued by Pew, which took a deep dive into the past, present, and future of Philly’s historic sacred spaces, which for the study’s purpose were defined as structures built for religious purposes before 1965.The researchers identified 839 historic sacred spaces remaining as of early 2016 (a couple have been demolished since then or marked for demolition). And despite common perceptions, a majority of them appeared to be relatively good shape. Yet the report comes out as Philly’s sacred spaces grapple with dwindling congregations and heated preservation battles over non-historically designated structures. In 1910, there were seven churches on Christian Street between Broad and 21st alone. Today, two remain. Another South Philly sacred space, the Christian Street Baptist Church, is currently embroiled in a battle between preservationists and a developer who wants to raze it and build rowhomes on the site. The report serves to highlight some of the successful ways that sacred spaces have adapted to modern times. Graduate Hospital’s Shiloh Baptist Church for example, was turned into a performance venue and now serves as a major community hub for the neighborhood. To get a full grasp on the current state of Philly’s historic sacred spaces, consider these five charts and maps. Thirteen percent of the 839 remaining sacred structures—no matter their current purpose—are located in Greater Center City. The southern and far northeast neighborhoods have the least amount of sacred spaces. Of the 839 total structures accounted for, 83 percent remain in use today for religious purposes. Another two percent are used as worship sites, though not as frequently as a normal congregation. And all of them happen to be Catholic churches. The report found that from 2011 to 2015, 39 of the 839 structures were vacant. Within that same time period, 23 sacred spaces were demolished. Rachel Hildebrandt of Partners for Sacred Places estimated that 22 were razed by developers. The report found that 82 structures, or 10 percent of the entire inventory, have found a second coming as everything from residential to performance venues to community centers. Most of these adaptive reuse projects are located in Greater Center City. Of the 5 percent of structures have been repurposed, most of them are now residential or single-family homes. Less common purposes include offices and commercial space. "
How Philly plans to become a Smart City ,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/18/16490980/philadelphia-smart-city-roadmap,article,"In February, Philly was one of five U.S. cities awarded a Smart Cities Council Readiness Challenge Grant. Essentially, the honor meant that Philly showed some great promise as a potential smart city, and the council wanted to help it find ways to use this type of technology to improve the lives of both residents and visitors. Eight months later, is Philly any smarter? After a workshop that brought more than 190 people to the Pennovation Center last week, Ellen Hwang would like to think so. But, she cautions, the city is still a long way from being truly smart. “This is the kick-off for our roadmap to the initiative,” said Hwang, the program manager for Innovation Management in the city’s Office of Innovation and Technology. “The event was not the be all and end all—it was to start the conversation.” The “Readiness Workshop” was part of the Smart Cities grant and meant to serve as a jumpstart to help the city develop a roadmap to becoming a Smart City. The Office of Technology will also use a $200,000 grant from the Knight Foundation to create the actual roadmap.One thing that will set Philly apart from other cities’ roadmaps is that it will be very focused on the community at both a general and individual level, said Charles Brennan, chief information officer of the Office of Innovation and Technology. “We’re a city of neighborhoods and each of the neighborhoods has different needs,” said. “So we wanted to be sure we get all that in a plan.” The roadmap, according to Brennan, is expected to be revealed sometime in the first quarter of 2018. His team and PwC-US Advisory will spend the next few months taking a deep data dive, all the while increasing engagement among various communities and stakeholders. “A lot of the folks in the room who come from the innovation side, they sleep and eat breath smart city stuff. They’re the usual suspects,” said Hwang. “But bringing in civic organizations, people who are really close on the ground at a grass-roots level—those aren’t the people who are often in on these conversations.” Here are just some of the most compelling ideas that the city is considering for its Smart City roadmap.The city already makes a lot of its information available to the public via its open data platform. Brennan says even before the Smart City grant his office was working to expand upon that by making some of the data—specifically its property information—even more accessible. In a few weeks the office will launch Atlas, a city app that will compile every single piece of information about properties in the city into one place. Users will be able to look up an individual property and see it from street and aerial view, while all of the location’s data will show up on the left side of the screen, down to how many 311 calls have been placed from the property.  “Parking will be a big issue in Center City,” said Brennan. The good news is that some other cities have already solved their respective parking problems through use of sensors or videos. Brennan thinks this could work in Philly, too. “A lot of the traffic involves people riding around looking for a parking spot. Not only are you burning gas or putting pollutants in the air, but you’re trying desperately to get to your restaurant reservation in time,” says Brennan. “Suppose there was an app that would alert you that a parking spot is within a block of where you want to go. Wouldn’t that be cool?” Philly’s infrastructure is already equipped with camera technology that Brennan says could be quickly deployed to be used for this parking solution. More wide-angle cameras could be installed all throughout the city and in parking garages that would scope out sites and alert your smartphone when and where there’s a spot available. “We could deploy them really quickly,” said Brennan. “We have a lot of fiber out there to put [out] an application like that.”But one major main theme of Philly’s Smart City roadmap will undoubtedly be digital inclusion, said Hwang. “I think a lot of times when you look at where people are deploying and piloting smart OIT solutions, they’re often in downtown areas where the infrastructure is already laid out. In order to make sure we’re not leaving any one community out, we’re thinking about hyper-local economic initiatives.” "
"500 Walnut, Phillys newest and most luxurious condo tower, in photos",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/18/16489680/500-walnut-scannapieco-philadelphia-photos,article,"Councilman Mark Squilla put it best when he tried to describe just how posh the new 500 Walnut tower really is: “What amazed me is that when you come into the building’s parking deck, it feels like you’re in a lobby of a hotel.” Squilla’s remarks came at the opening of developer Tom Scannapieco’s latest project, a 26-story tower at the corner of 5th and Walnut. The skinny, angular tower was designed by Cecil Baker + Partners and features just 35 condo residences and a impressive list of high-end amenities that make it one of the city’s most exclusive, luxurious residential projects to date. It also has some of the priciest pads in Philly: In June 2016, the project made real estate history with the sale of its bi-level penthouse for $17.85 million, the most expensive residential transaction in the history of Philadelphia. Meanwhile, the price tag on the tower’s smallest residences, already 2,700 square feet, is $3 million.  Scannapieco, whose most recent project is 1706 Rittenhouse, said, “This project is the pinnacle of my career.” The property was the last-remaining site for development around Independence Mall, and highly sought-after by both local and out-of-town developers, recalled Cecil Baker. “I’ve been identified with this site for many years and did many plans with developers from New York, Chicago, Philadelphia—and they could never make it work,” he said. “And they walked away from this a little bit poorer, with bruised egos. And then along came Tom.”It’s a complicated site—and not just because it’s located across the street from Independence Hall, a UNESCO Heritage site that’s part of the national park. 500 Walnuts sits a super-skinny site on the corner of 5th and Walnut; it essentially spoons its neighbor, the Penn Mutual Tower at 510 Walnut. But Baker’s angular design and multiple setbacks on the 4th and 13th floors were also intentional: It allows the building to be hidden from view when visitors at the Liberty Bell look toward Independence Hall. That was a requirement from the National Park Service. Mayor Jim Kenney weighed in on the design, too, saying, “We must continue this trend of both embracing the new and modern while still celebrating our history. The record-breaking impact of 500 Walnut is just the beginning of progress I hope we will make here.” The project broke ground in March 2015 and only topped off in March 2017. It’s about 75 percent sold, and throughout the rest of the year and winter residents will continue to move into their homes, which range from 2,700 to 8,900 square feet. Only one to two residences take up each floor. Here’s a peek into the tower’s luxurious list of amenities: The underground parking garage holds up to 86 cars, which comes out to more than two cars per household. But the real kicker about this amenity is that all residents have to do is swipe their key fob and wait for their car to be delivered to them in less than 90 seconds. This amenity is only available here and at Scannapieco’s other project 1706 Rittenhouse. Even residents who don’t have their own car to park in the robotic garage are hooked up: There’s a Tesla town car available, in addition to 24/7 concierge services. Every resident has access to a 4,000-square-foot terrace on the fourth floor. The expansive outdoor space looks over Independence Park. It has an outdoor fireplace, multiple built-in benches and outdoor seatings, and a gazebo. Also on this level is a game room, a conference room, another impressive fireplace, and a fitness center with sauna and massage rooms. But perhaps one of the most stunning spaces is the 50-foot indoor lap pool and jacuzzi. The whole space is sky-lit. So what’s next for Scannapieco? He’s been in talks with the Society Hill neighborhood once again for another condo tower, this time at the Ritz-5 movie complex. But, quipped Baker, “He said to me, ‘This time, let’s do a real modern building.’”"

Four townhomes at 3200 Summer Street, located at the foot of the 16-story rental tower, are currently under construction and looking for their first owners. The whole development, dubbed Summer12, will include one dozen homes.All of the homes that are currently for sale feature two bedrooms and two and a half baths, ranging in size from 1,149 to 1,302 square feet. They also have roof decks or private gardens and terraces. Parking is available, too, but for an extra $50,000. Summer12 is the second phase of the site’s larger mixed-use development by Radnor Property Group. After finishing construction on the 164-unit apartment building Vue32 earlier this summer, the developer began work on the 12 townhomes. Like the rentals, the townhomes are likely to be attractive to the local eds and meds; it’s located within the UPenn Homeownership Program and the Drexel Homeownership Program communities. The first set of homes are expected to be move-in ready by spring 2018. Editor’s note: A previous version stated that the starting price of the Summer12 townhomes was $325,000. We regret the error. "
38 affordable rentals coming to Hunting Parks Roberto Clemente Middle School ,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/16/16481386/philly-affordable-housing-esperanza-groundbreaking-roberto-clemente,article,"After sitting vacant at North 5th and Luzerne for more than a decade, work has begun to re-open the former Roberto Clemente Middle School as a new affordable housing community. On Friday, Esperanza, a non-profit that aims to help strengthen Hispanic communities in and around Philly, broke ground on the Roberto Clemente Homes, 38 affordable rental units and 5,000 square feet of retail at the seven-story school. “For so many years, the building was not only a safety hazard, but an ugly and discouraging presence in our community,” said Rev. Luis Cortés, Jr., Founder, President and CEO of Esperanza in a statement. The Roberto Clemente Middle School is more than a century old, designed by Frederick Muhlenberg in 1924 as the Apex Hosiery Factory. It was eventually converted into the Pennsylvania Advancement Middle School, and later renamed after Roberto Clemente, the famous baseball player. But it has been closed for a decade. In that time, it’s stood as a symbol of blight and crime in the Hunting Park community. In 2013, Esperanza began the process of purchasing the building from the School District of Philadelphia and ultimately acquired it in September 2016. Since then, Esperanza has completed asbestos remediation at the site and has started a partial demolition under Domus Construction that will bring the seven-story building down to three stories. A parking lot and a children’s play area will also be built at the site. The hope, Cortes, Jr. said, is that the project will be transformational for the Hunting Park neighborhood and provide more opportunities and a “better standard of living” for the community. The homes are expected to be move-in ready in 2018. "
16 condos to replace demolished Graduate Hospital church,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/12/16464758/17th-bainbridge-condos-graduate-hospital,article,"Farewell, 150-year-old church. Hello, new condos. Work is underway on a new 16-unit condo development called Portofino at 17th and Bainbridge in Graduate Hospital, Naked Philly reports. According to building permits, there will be four triplexes and one quadraplex, totaling 16 condos in the development at 1701-9 Bainbridge Street. Renderings reveal that the units, clad in a mix of materials that includes brick, will also include back patios and terraces. Noah Ostroff, whose PhillyLiving.com real estate team is behind the project, tells Curbed Philly that the condos will be built in less than a year. “We should be finished by the beginning of the summer,” he said. For nearly 150 years, that corner was home to the New Light Beulah Baptist Church before it met the wrecking ball this summer. Construction on the condos began soon after. Ostroff shared a sneak peek of the new development. "
Construction begins on $199M View II student housing project by Temple ,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/12/16463878/view-ii-temple-housing-goldenberg-group-groundbreaking,article,"Construction has begun on a $199 million student housing development that will bring 368 “resort-style” apartments to the edge of Temple’s campus. The project, dubbed View II, is the second and final phase of Goldenberg Group’s master plan to redevelop a 4.6-acre site at 1101 Cecil B. Moore Avenue that was formerly the John Wanamaker High School. When View II finishes construction in summer 2019, the site will include more than 1,800 beds and 40,000 square feet of retail. Goldenberg announced the groundbreaking Wednesday afternoon. The by-right project will total 470,000 square feet and include one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom apartments that are fully furnished, complete with flat screen TV’s. Like the original View, which has 832 fully-leased rentals, View II will have a long list of amenities that one has come to expect in new mixed-use developments: A coffee bar, fitness center, an outdoor terrace, conference rooms, and bike storage. Despite pushback from the community earlier this year, the development will also include 94 below-grade parking spots, as well as electric-charging stations. Kevin Trapper, senior vice president for Goldenberg Group, said in Wednesday’s announcement that the goal of the project is to “be a source of positive transformation in the neighborhood” while at the same time protecting the mostly residential communities near Temple from student sprawl. View II is expected to be move-in ready by fall 2019. "

The Inquirer first noted the listing, which is being handled by Rittenhouse Realty Advisors. It for states that the 1.05-acre site at 1100 N. Delaware Avenue is the last-remaining site in Fishtown (referred to as the “Brooklyn of Philadelphia”) available that allows for this amount of density.Developer and current owner Core Realty already has all of the approvals in place to turn the historic warehouse and the parking lot into a mixed-use development with 179 apartments and commercial space. Grid City Climbing has already signed on, leasing 22,000 square feet of space for a rock climbing gym. But the developer did run into some hardships regarding the restoration of the Ed Corner building. In April of this year, the Philadelphia Historical Commission ruled in favor of the developer’s plea for hardship, allowing Core Realty to build a three-story apartment addition to the structure in order to balance the cost of restoring the deteriorated building. But by the looks of it, Core Realty wants out of the project. The listing states that whoever buys the site could forge ahead with it, breaking ground in 2018. "
The Curtis building nabs $173M loan to help finish apartments conversion,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/10/16452280/curtis-building-philadelphia-construction-renovation-apartments,article,"The developers behind the renovation of the historic Curtis building on Washington Square just nabbed a $173.25 million loan that will help bring construction of luxury apartments to the finish line.JLL Capital Markets announced that it secured the multi-million dollar loan for developer and owner Keystone Property Group. Some of the funds will be used to pay off some debt, while $30 million will go toward the completion of the Curtis building’s 63 residential units and future office and retail space. Keystone Property Group purchased the building at 6th and Walnut for $125 million in 2014. Soon after, the developer began renovations on the property, restoring the 12-story atrium and bringing on tenants like the restaurant P.J. Clarke’s.A post shared by Lyndon at The Curtis (@liveatlyndon) on Aug 30, 2017 at 8:15am PDTThe debut of the residential component, dubbed the Lyndon at the Curtis, has been pushed back by months. The 63 high-end luxury units are located on the upper floors of the 12-story building. Though it was expected to start leasing for late spring move-ins, it is now leasing for the fall. Currently, prices range from $2,702 for a 899-square-foot one-bedroom apartment to $6,585 for a 1,681-square-foot three-bedroom unit. Eventually, there will also be apartments up to 2,000 square feet available. In an interview with Curbed Philly earlier this year, Rich Gottlieb of Keystone Property Group said views from the apartments are just one of the perks. Residents will also have access to a long list of amenities like a clubroom, fitness center, private dining room, and a dog spa. Gottlieb said residential component of the Curtis made sense for the neighborhood, where there is still room for rentals in a condo-heavy location. The hope is that the addition of restaurants, retail, office, and residential to Washington Square will help it become a 24/7 destination versus a nine-to-five hub, he said. According to the Lyndon’s website, some of the first apartments will be move-in ready by late October. "
Chinatown just broke ground on its 20-story Eastern Tower,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/6/16438060/chinatown-eastern-tower-groundbreaking-philadelphia,article,"After 16 years, countless design proposals, years of fundraising, and navigating plenty hiccups along the way, Chinatown has officially and finally broken ground on the Eastern Tower Community Center at 10th and Vine. The project is a $75 million venture that will bring 150 apartments to the site, as well as office, commercial, and retail space. But most importantly, it will include a community and recreation center, the first for the Chinatown neighborhood. “It is in the community and for the community,” said Margaret Chin, chairwoman of the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC). The Friday groundbreaking ceremony was a display of Chinese culture, with dragon dances by the Philadelphia Suns and fireworks that shot off at the site of the future tower. But the ceremony was ultimately a celebration for the community, which has been working since, really, the 1990s to get this project going. Talk to anyone involved in this project over the years and they’ll tell you, with an air of exasperation or relief, that there’s been a lot of touch-and-go moments since conceptual design phase began in 2001. After many delayed groundbreaking dates, it got to the point where many began to wonder if the project would ever happen at all. “Every single bump in the road you can possibly have on a project, it had,” said Michael O’Brien, a state representative who’s been involved in the project from the early stages. “But this community never gave up.” Thee initial project concept started out as a place for the Chinatown community to gather and for the Philadelphia Suns to practice. John Chin of PCDC and Ahsan Nratullah of JNA Capital started a grass-roots fundraising campaign for the project, garnering funding from all levels of government, including federal, state, and city, as well private donations from equity groups and the Chinatown community. In addition, the parking lot at 10th and Vine was purchased from the city’s Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority, adding even more paperwork to the process. Said PRA’s executive director Greg Heller, “This is one of the most complicated projects in Philadelphia.” It wasn’t until PCDC secured a $22.5 million construction loan from Citizens Bank in late August that general contractor Hunter Roberts was given the green light to begin construction.With work now officially underway, construction is expected to take 26 months. When the tower opens in 2019, it will serve as a bookend to the 10th Street commercial corridor, which starts at Chinatown’s Friendship Gate at Arch Street. Two commercial tenants have already been secured for the tower’s ground level: Chinatown Learning Center has signed on as a bilingual preschool and pre-kindergarten program and a new restaurant will also set up shop. Perhaps Chin said it best Friday afternoon: “This has been a long-awaited dream of Chinatown. It’s not a dream anymore.” "
"Philly court offices out, apartments in at 1401 Arch building",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/6/16430922/1401-arch-building-apartments-philadelphia,article,"The 14-story building at 1401 Arch Street is set to make the switch from court offices to apartments. First Judicial District of Pennsylvania’s Probation and Pretrial Departments is moving from Arch Street to its new 120,000-square-foot home at 714 Market Street, the Inquirer reported. The move was announced Thursday by CBRE, which handled the deal with CVA Commercial Group. The plan at 1401 Arch is for the new owner, Alterra Property Group, to swap out the offices for apartments. That won’t happen for awhile though, since FJD’s move from the building to 714 Market won’t be until the end of 2018. “FJD now has the opportunity to vacate a building that was functionally obsolete for their purposes, and custom design new space in a location that is accessible to the courts, their clients and employees,” said CBRE senior vice president Michael Kane in a statement. 1401 Market dates back to 1898 and was designed by Wilson Brothers & Company as the headquarters for United Glass Improvement (UGI). A later addition by Perry, Shaw & Hepburn in 1923 was added to the tower’s south side, which is what now faces the Thomas Paine Plaza. The building is currently zoned CMX-5, which allows for the highest and most dense development.If and when the apartment conversion happens, it will be another residential investment along North Broad, which has been undergoing a major revitalization in recent years. 1401 Arch Street and the recently opened Aloft Hotel directly across the street would potentially serve as a gateway to the corridor. Curbed Philly reached out to Alterra Property Group for a comment regarding the 1401 Market project. This article will be updated when we learn more. Stay tuned. "
Design committee tells two-tower proposal on Schuylkill to try again,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/4/16409006/pmc-river-walk-towers-gensler-design-review-recap,article,"Describing the project as a “bitter pill to swallow,” the Civic Design Review committee asked the design and development team behind a proposed two-tower project on the Schuylkill to make a long list of changes and present their design proposal again at a later date.The vote was made at Tuesday’s monthly Civic Design Review meeting, where Gensler and PMC Property Group presented the design proposal for two towers to be built on the two last-remaining developable sites along the Schuylkill River. Plans for this project were officially announced in November 2016, although it has been at least two years in the making with PMC Property Group. The developer received a zoning extension approval earlier this year, allowing the development to be built by-right on what’s currently a parking lot. Since the project proposes more than 100,000 square feet of new construction and more than 100 residential units, it had to go through the Civic Design Review process, which is a non-binding, advisory subcommittee of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. The developer and designers prefaced their presentation by explaining the two site’s complexities. Bordered by the river’s edge, a SEPTA rail line, Cherry Street, and 23rd Street, the two sites are located within a floodplain. There’s also an portion of the property that falls beneath an elevated SEPTA rail line. Its location in Logan Square as one of the last-remaining lots on the Schuylkill also means that building anything here would potentially block views of residents in adjacent buildings. It’s one of the main reasons why Gensler designed the two towers to be situated perpendicular to the river versus parallel. The design committee praised Genslers’ work generally, but pointed many of its critiques of the project to its relation to the public realm. Committee chair and architect Nancy Rogo-Trainer said, “It seems to be more of a project that is a hotel—it doesn’t seem to integrate with the city.” Currently, the project calls for both the south and north towers to have podiums to accommodate 192 parking spaces total. This would result in a majority of the buildings’ street level to be wrapped in perforated metal, which is meant to be transparent. But designers said it tends to come off as more opaque than intended. Said Rogo-Trainer, “You’re taking a dead parking lot and making dead walls.” She suggested incorporating more street-level retail to help enliven the edges. Architect Cecil Baker also weighed in, expressing his frustration with the parking podiums. “This project is a bitter pill to swallow,” he said. “Why are we not asking the developer to put at least some of the parking underground?” But Kevin Golden, representing PMC Property Group, argued that it is not economically feasible to build underground parking on this particular site, which is located with a floodplain. He challenged Baker to find a retailer that would sign a lease for a space that’s at risk of flooding. One of Baker’s most recently completed projects includes Carl Dranoff’s One Riverside condo tower farther south on the Schuylkill River Trail. It includes underground parking, but not retail. The committee also wasn’t a fan of the drawbridge connecting the two towers. The bridge is meant to serve as a connection for residents from the south tower to access the building’s amenities in the north tower. But it was compared to pedestrian bridges one typically finds in a hotel or a hospital. “The most enjoyable experience is at street level,” said Dan Garofalo, environmental sustainable director of Penn’s Sustainability Office. “Drop the bridge.” But what committee member Ashley DiCaro said was the “sad part of the project” was that the bridge and the towers would create a wall, blocking the rest of the neighborhood residents from easily accessing the Schuylkill River Trail. She suggested that other material choices be considered that weren’t so dark, warning the team that “in reality, I worry we’re creating another PECO building.” Every committee member except Leo Addimando of Alterra Property Group voted to continue the CDR process. Gensler and PMC Property Group will be required to present one more time to the committee. Following that, the goal is for construction to begin on the north tower first, along with the build-out of the south tower’s podium. Assuming that “leasing is favorable” in the first tower, Golden said work will start on the remainder of the south tower. "
Developers buy up 801 Market building in $96M deal,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/3/16410990/801-market-philadelphia-sold,article,"Thanks to a nearly $100 million deal, the historic building at 801 Market has a new owner. A $96 million financing package was secured in mid-September for developers Cohen Properties and Taconic Capital Advisors to purchase a portion of 801 Market Street. Cohen Properties, which already owns floors seven through 13, is now part-owner of floors three through six. JLL Capital Markets secured the financial package for the developers. The $96 million will be used to both buy the lower half of the building and rehab the 695,130-square-foot office tower. The purchase comes as the Market East corridor undergoes a major rennaisance while offering the most affordable retail rents in the country. In addition to PREIT’s redevelopment of the Gallery Mall into the Fashion District, construction on the $600 million East Market mixed-use development is well underway, with big-name tenants like signed on or already moved in. The 801 Market building dates back to 1931, when it was built for $10 million as a Strawbridge and Clothier department store. Developer PREIT still owns the first and second floors of the building, which will become part of its $365 million development of the Fashion District of Philadelphia next door.Meanwhile, the 801 Market office building is already leased by the Philadelphia Media Network and the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Health and Human Services (HHS), which signed a 10-year lease in August 2016.

30th St. Station master developer search delayed due to Amazon HQ2,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/3/16404122/amtrak-30th-street-station-rfq-delay-amazon-headquarters,article,"Amtrak’s search for a master developer to take on its 30th Street Station District Plan just came to a halt in light of all of the Amazon hubbub. Amtrak sent an e-mail to interested developers yesterday announcing the postponement of its request for qualifications (RFQ) for a master developer, the Inquirer first reported. The search will pick up again in early 2018. The RFQ was issued in late August, seeking a developer to implement Amtrak’s 30th Street Station District Plan, a $6.5 billion venture to improve the station and create a mixed-use development all around the station. Why the halt? Amazon.It sounds like Amtrak is seriously considering Philly’s pitch to bring Amazon’s second headquarters to the city. The area surrounding the 30th Street Station District Master Plan, which includes Schuylkill Yards, is said to be one of the spots being pitched by the city to Amazon. Amtrak’s e-mail is in full is below: In light of the recent announcement by Amazon of its search for a second corporate headquarters and the City of Philadelphia’s interest in submitting a proposal, Amtrak has decided to postpone the current Philadelphia Master Developer Partnership Request for Qualifications (RFQ) until early 2018.While Philadelphia is still determining the best site to present to Amazon, Amtrak feels it best to suspend its solicitation for a master developer until such time a decision on the Amazon headquarters has been made.Please be aware that Amtrak’s RFQ for Philadelphia Master Developer has been cancelled with no further information available at this time. All events, site tours and due dates have been cancelled.Pitches to Amazon are due by October 19. Stay tuned."
"More senior affordable housing on the way in South, West Philly",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/2/16372914/philadelphia-senior-affordable-housing-south-philly,article,"Construction is underway at two sites in South and West Philly to bring more than 100 senior affordable housing units to the neighborhoods.Within two weeks, the non-profit organization Presby’s Inspired Life broke ground this month on two low-income housing developments: A 61-unit project at 5th and Cantrell streets in South Philly and a 60-unit project at Presby’s 58th Street Campus in West Philly. The first development Cantrell Place broke ground at 5th and Cantrell two weeks ago, although it has been in the works since 2011. The two-building project will transform 33 vacant lots around the neighborhood (which happens to be a block away from where Mayor Jim Kenney grew up) into affordable housing for seniors aged 62 and older. Construction is expected to finish up in August 2018. The second project, which broke ground on Wednesday morning, is an adaptive reuse project that will convert an old nursing home, vacant since 2010, on Presby’s campus into 60 units for seniors. Some of the housing will be reserved for homeless seniors and those with sensory or mobility impairments. (Research shows that just 1 percent of the nation’s current housing stock offers what seniors need to safely age in place.)The new housing will be the fourth development to join Presby’s 58th Street Campus in Kingsessing. When it finishes construction in September 2018, it will only partially appease the demand for senior affordable housing at the campus—there’s currently a 500-person waiting list. The groundbreakings come at a time when Philly continues to struggle with its affordable housing availability, a growing senior population, and a high poverty rate. Last year, 176,645 Philadelphians (11 percent of the population) aged 55 or older were living below the poverty line, according to most recent U.S. Census data. "
Philly ranks 8th in nation for green residential projects,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/25/16360688/philadelphia-leed-residential-buildings-ranking,article,"How “green” is Philly? It’s environmentally friendly enough to rank 8th in the nation for LEED-certified residential projects, according to a new study. Real estate website ADOBO recently revealed a new ranking of the U.S. cities with the most certified green construction. Philly fared pretty well, cracking the top 10 list with 909 LEED-certified residential projects under its belt. The average square footage of these green projects in Philly comes out to 17,901 square feet, with 0.15 projects per 1,000 people. Philly’s numbers are nothing to scoff at. But they pale in comparison to the so-called LEED Capital of the U.S. That title goes to Washington, D.C., which has 2,675 LEED-certified residential projects—more than double the amount of Philly, according to the ADOBO report. A previous study that named Philly 11th in nation for green buildings, both residential and commercial, that are either LEED-certified or Energy Star compliant. It found that just 2 percent of the building’s in the city are LEED-certified. But while Philly does have some catching up to do compared to other major U.S. cities, an increasing number of residential and commercial construction projects have recently delivered and more are in the works and expected to add to the city’s collection of LEED buildings. One of the city’s most recent LEED-certified projects includes Penn’s New College House Dormitory by Bohlin Cywynski Jackson. The dormitory is LEED Gold certified and was recently named a 2017 Groundbreaker by the Delaware Valley Green Building Council. The building, situated on rolling hills in the middle of Penn’s campus, features plenty of green roofs. The Navy Yard is home to a growing collection of LEED buildings, and the Goldtex apartment building in Callowhill was the city’s first LEED-certified high-rise. And when it opens in 2018, the Comcast Technology Center will aim for LEED Platinum certification, the highest level available. "
"New renderings, details revealed for proposed River Walk towers ",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/25/16360368/pmc-river-walk-towers-gensler-renderings-design-review,article,"New renderings for the proposed River Walk mixed-use development on one of the last-remaining parcels on the Schuylkill River have been revealed ahead of next month’s Civic Design Review meeting. In October, PMC Property and Gensler will present updated plans to build two skinny and glassy towers at 60 N. 23rd Street and 2301 JFK Boulevard. The former is a 28-story tower to the north and the latter is a 38-story tower to the south.Plans for this project were officially announced in November 2016. The project can be built by-right and received a zoning extension approval earlier this year, with the goal of breaking ground by the summer. But because the application proposes more than 100,000 square feet of new construction and more than 100 residential units, it has to go through the Civic Design Review, which is a non-binding review process. Here’s the breakdown for each tower: Eventually, a residential bridge will connect the north tower with the 32-story tower to the south, passing over a walkway and two-way driveway between the two buildings. When plans were first announced, details were slim on the project. But Gensler’s principal and design director David Epstein told Curbed Philly at the time that the mixed-use development would likely attract young professionals. Of the buildings, Epstein said the design would “make it feel different than a lot of these glassy buildings of today.” The plans will be presented at the Civic Design Review meeting on October 5. "
96 apartments in store for Callowhills Heid building,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/21/16339530/heid-building-callowhill-apartments-renderings-prdc-properties,article,"An old hat-making warehouse located just past the Vine Street Expressway in Callowhill is about to become an amenity-driven, mixed-use apartment building. The Heid Building at 323 N. 13th Street used to be the home of Frank P. Heid & Company, which once held the title of being the largest hat- and cap-making company in Philly. But like many other warehouses all throughout the city, this one has been vacant for the past 11 years. That’s all set to change with the announcement that local developer PRDC Properties will be bringing 96 market-rate one- and two-bedroom apartments to the site, with rents ranging from $1,100 to $2,200 a month. It will also be home to a ground-floor restaurant and a roof top amenity level with swinging hammocks, fire pits, a dog park, and an indoor-outdoor kitchen. “We want it so that everyone can live outside of the apartment,” said PRDC Properties president Jon Thomas at Wednesday’s announcement on the fourth floor of the Heid Building. “This building will give you the opportunity to do that.” The project and the apartments will be designed by Shimi Zakin of the local architecture firm Atrium Design Group. But for the building’s actual build out, PRDC Properties will be helped by 20 high school students from Ben Franklin High School’s Career & Technical Education Vocational Center. The partnership, encouraged by City Councilman and real estate magnate Allan Domb, will train students on the job, allowing them to be a part of the construction process at the Heid Building from start to finish. “We think this public-private partnership has the ability to be life-altering,” said PRDC Properties chief operating officer Brandon Morrison to a crowd of students at the announcement. Morrison worked with Domb to put the internship program together.The Heid building adaptive reuse effort is the latest redevelopment project to come to Callowhill, a neighborhood that’s been experiencing a recent renaissance. Its location, within steps of the future Rail Park and a 10-minute walk to Center City, has made the area attractive to developers in recent years.  The move made sense for PRDC Properties, which is known for its luxury home developments (it recently broke ground on a 44-townhome community in Northern Liberties with starting prices at $699,000.). It also led the restoration of the historic Lincoln apartment building in Washington Square West. Mayor Jim Kenney was on hand at the announcement. Keeping his remarks short, he encouraged the students to “be on time” and thanked the developer for preserving the building. Councilman Domb added, “You can’t live in history in any other city like you can in Philly. This is living history.”Construction is expected to begin in November and take 15 months. "
7 major projects set to transform Phillys parking lots,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/13/14460108/philadelphia-developments-on-parking-lots-transformation,article,"Editor’s note: This article was originally published on February 13, 2017 and has been updated with the most recent information.The building boom in Philadelphia is changing the skyline at a rapid pace, with more than 20 high-rises currently under construction. An estimated 1.4 million square feet of new office construction alone is set to deliver in the city by 2020. Welcome to Curbed’s first-ever Transportation Week! From how to improve public transportation in cities, ranking the best car-free neighborhoods across the country, and a friendly competition between NYC, San Francisco, and Los Angeles to determine which has the best public transit, this week is all about how we get around in our favorite cities. All aboard!All that to say: Philly’s corners are going to look very different in a few years, especially with the amount of mixed-use, walkable developments in the works. Amid all of this new construction, there is one noticeable trend: The rise of residential, retail, and office towers on former parking lots. (It’s not just parking lots, either. As architecture critic Inga Saffron noted recently, Philly’s parking garages are getting the boot, too.) For a city where a majority of households still drive a car to work, this is significant. Below, see how seven major projects—all currently at various development stages—are set to transform parking lots throughout the city, from Logan Square to Fishtown.Most recently, this parking lot on the corner of South Broad Street and Washington Avenue served as place to dump piles of snow. But in late 2018, it will be home to Lincoln Square, a mixed-use development with 322 apartments and 100,000 square feet of retail, which includes the rehab of a historic train shed into a grocery store and a Target. Developers Kimco Realty, Alterra Property Group, and MIS Capital and BLT Architects are behind the project. Construction began in late December and early January and the nine-story building is currently on the rise.In three years, this parking lot at 13th and Market will be replaced by a 38-story office tower designed by Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill (SOM). The glassy building will clock in at 840,000 square feet and will feature retail and roof top terraces, with neighbors City Hall and Macy’s close by. In May 2017 the future tower began leasing. This parking lot at 23rd and Arch is one of the last open spots remaining along the Schuylkill River Trail. In November 2016, PMC Property Group announced that its plans to build two residential towers, by right, on the site. The original plan was to break ground on the Gensler-designed project in late spring or summer, but that date has been pushed back and work still has yet to begin. Continuing the building boom on North Broad, this parking lot at 510 N. Broad Street will feature two towers designed by BLT Architects and developed by Parkway Corp. and Nightingale. The $300 million undertaking will be an office and residential project, and a design departure from BLT Architect’s more traditional-leaning portfolio. Retail is also in the works for the parking lot across the street next to the Mural Lofts as a separate project by Eric Blumenfeld. The developer as started actively marketing the project, which is being called True North. Its website says to expect a Spring 2019 opening.With its recent groundbreaking, by the end of summer in 2018, this site at 440 N. 15th Street will have a 10-story apartment building on its grounds, the first of two residential towers called the Hamilton. Radnor Property Group and the Community College of Philadelphia are behind the $150 million by-right, multi-phase project that will include 600 apartments and underground parking. The The second, taller 16-story tower will be built in the second phase on the site’s current parking lot. In November 2016, Core Realty and Stanev Pott Architects presented to the Civic Design Review their plans to build a mixed-use residential project with a massive rock-climbing gym on a parking lot at 1100 N. Delaware Avenue. The new building will house apartments on the top five stories and a 22,000 square-foot-space for Grid City Climbing. The Ed Corner building on the site will also be converted into residential units.The parking lot at 10th and Vine is slowly but surely disappearing to make way for the long-awaited 20-story Eastern Tower Community Center. Talks to build this tower for the Chinatown neighborhood began in 2011, but it took years to raise enough money to get the project off the ground. It will bring 147 market-rate apartments, three affordable units, and 44,200-square-feet of commercial and retail space to the lot. "
7 game-changing transportation projects planned for Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/18/16227724/philadelphia-top-transportation-infrastructure-projects,article,"Welcome to Curbed’s first-ever Transportation Week! From how to improve public transportation in cities, ranking the best car-free neighborhoods across the country, and a friendly competition between NYC, San Francisco, and Los Angeles to determine which has the best public transit, this week is all about how we get around in our favorite cities. All aboard!Philly is on the move, whether it’s by car, bus, bike, subway, or foot. More and more people are riding SEPTA, bike lanes are slowly but surely being added to the streets, and we’ve finally made the switch from tokens to card payments. his city continues to be one of the most walkable in the nation. But there’s still a lot of work to be done when it comes to improving and building Philly’s transportation infrastructure. Here, we highlight six transportation projects that all have potential to be game-changers for this city and its 1.5 million residents.    This $6.5 billion project led by Amtrak has set the bar high: Its overarching goal is to transform both 30th Street Station and the surrounding area into an innovative transportation hub and mixed-use neighborhood. How so? By building out 18 million square feet of new development and 40 acres of green space. Already, Amtrak is in search of a master developer to take on the big-time project. But this project isn’t just about creating more green space and new buildings. A big portion of this master plan involves the actual 30th Street Station, which already sees about 4 million Amtrak passengers travel through each year—that number is projected to double by 2040. As it stands now, the station and the surrounding area isn’t very pedestrian- or traveler-friendly, for that matter. Much of the planned changes directly involving 30th Street Station involve creating more public space and addressing the traffic issues. Loading will be changed, there will be a new bus station that doesn’t require crossing a busy intersection. And—fingers crossed—there will be a direct underground connection between the SEPTA line and Amtrak. The Navy Yard has been on the rise for years now, with more than $1 billion in both public and private investment. Today, it’s home to 1,200 acres, and houses some 150 companies. But to date, the thousands of employees who commute here every day have had to do so by shuttle bus or car. That could change eventually, with a feasibility study underway to extend the Broad Street subway line from the final stop at the stadiums to the Navy Yard. The study (the second of its kind) kicked off in late 2014 and results are expected to be released this year, according to the Broad Street extension’s official timeline. The estimated $500 million project could mean big things for the Navy Yard, among them turning the work-driven campus into a livable place. Building housing here has always been a long-term goal of the Navy Yard, and adding another transit connection between the area and the rest of Philly might just be the impetus to make that happen. The 40th Street Trolley Portal at 40th Street, Baltimore Avenue, and Woodland Avenue is the city’s busiest above-ground trolley station in Philly. And it was arguably one one of the city’s most bland and drab stations. That’s why University City District spent years raising $2.1 million to transform the portal into what it’s now calling the 40th Street Trolley Portal Gardens. With construction well underway, the “unsightly expanse of concrete” will be turned into a welcoming transportation hub with landscaping, public space with seating, and a Trolley Car Station restaurant. Aside from beautifying the public space, the redesign should also help make the trolley portal safer for pedestrians and trolley riders. Before construction began, the concrete plaza—situated between three busy roads—lacked clear walkways, which often resulted in pedestrians darting across train tracks to catch the trolley. Roosevelt Boulevard in Northeast Philly is notorious for being home to some of the most dangerous intersections in the nation. At times along the 15-mile traffic artery there are as many as 12 lanes, making “the Boulevard” one of the most heavily congested roads in the city. That’s why the Boulevard is now the site of one of SEPTA’s high-priority projects. On September 8, SEPTA launched the new Boulevard Direct route, a rapid bus transit system along that includes bus-only lanes and eight stops from Neshaminy Mall in Bucks County to Frankford Transportation Center. Although it’s only been open for a couple of weeks, studies show that commute times are expected to decrease by 30 percent. This project is just the first effort to make Roosevelt Boulevard safer; it’s also one of Vision Zero’s high-priority areas, so expect to hear more about the boulevard’s future in the coming months. A post shared by BCGP (@bicyclecoalition) on Aug 29, 2017 at 7:52am PDTPrior to taking office, Mayor Jim Kenney pledged to create 30 miles of protected bike lanes throughout city—at the time, Philly had zero. Today, it has funding in place to make this campaign promise become reality, and the city has at least one two-way protected bike lane and another one-way protected bike lane in University City. It may not sound like much, but Philly’s Complete Streets director Kelley Yemen assures that implementation of more protected bike lanes is underway—the hard part is figuring out which streets need these type of bike lanes and then getting the city and neighborhoods to agree to them. But protected bike paths aren’t the only things on the wish list of the biking community. There are also longterm goals like Circuit Trails, which hopes to build out a 750-mile network of bicycle and pedestrian trails throughout the Philly metro region. And then there’s the Schuylkill River Trail, which has many more trails planned to connect the waterfront with multi-modal paths. The King of Prussia Rail Line has been a long time coming—and there’s still ways to go. Spearheaded by SEPTA, this effort to connect King of Prussia with the Norris High Speed Line (NHSL) has been years in the making since 2012 and is currently waiting for   a release of the Environmental Impact Study. Proponents of the project say it has the potential to be a game-changer for the already booming suburb that’s just 20 miles from Philly, but offers no direct public transportation access. One study found that the rail line could add anywhere from $540 million to $946 million to the assessed value of existing real estate in the area, and encourage new development of up to 8 million square feet.If all goes to plan, KOP could see an operational train by 2025. Rounding out this list of highly-anticipated transportation projects is the most recently announced capping of I-95 and Penn’s Landing. The $225 million project will put a park over the interstate between Chestnut and Walnut streets, and slope down over Penn’s Landing, which is currently a heavy-concrete public space on the Delaware River. The effort has been many years in the making and is an effort to essentially undo the damage that I-95 created in the 1970s-1980s when it was built, cutting through numerous Philly neighborhoods and making access to the river much more difficult. We’ve already seen some signs of construction work here with the dismantling of a pair of scissor ramps, but it’ll be a few more years until Philly sees the final product. "

Zoning board denies Quaker warehouse apartment conversion,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/14/16306548/post-brothers-apartments-quaker-warehouse-north-philly,article,"Plans to turn a blighted North Philly warehouse into a mixed-use development with apartments and retail hit a snag Wednesday when the Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) denied the developer’s request for a zoning variance. Last week, local developer Post Brothers announced that it was in the works to buy the old Quaker building at 900-58 N. 9th Street and Poplar. The developer planned to turn the 10-story, 380,000-square-foot property into a luxury apartment building with 350 units on the third through 10th floors and commercial and office space on the first two levels.  The property is zoned industrial, so a variance was requested for mixed-use residential use.At yesterday’s hearing, the ZBA denied the request 4 to 1, stating that the current zoning did not present any hardships and the building should be continued to be used for industrial purposes.When reached for comment via e-mail following Wednesday’s hearing, Post Brothers’ Michael Pestronk expressed frustration with what he called the board’s “beyond disingenuous” and politically motivated decision.The Quaker building is currently owned by Philadelphia Suburban Development Corporation and dates back to 1918, when it served as a warehouse for Strawbridge & Clothier. Later, it became a facility for Quaker Storage Company. But for the past two decades or so, the building has sat vacant. Pestronk argued that restoring the property for industrial use isn’t economically feasible for a number of a reasons, including building’s current dilapidated state. “Prevailing industrial rents would not support the renovation costs necessary to make the building” workable, according to Pestronk. In the beginning stages of the project, neighbors expressed concern of being priced out of the apartments, which Post Brothers told the Inquirer would be available “be affordable to renters earning a first-year teacher’s salary,” or $45,360 a year.Still, going into Wednesday’s zoning meeting Post Brothers said it had the support of two Registered Community Organizations (RCO’s). The developer had promised to work out a community benefit agreements with the neighborhood, including hiring local minority-owned companies for the project.But with the zoning request denied, it’s back to the drawing board. Pestronk said Post Brothers will appeal the decision, adding, “We will continue to work with the RCOs, and the community benefit agreements we signed will take effect when the project gets off the ground.” "
URBNs dreamy Terrain Gardens to open at Devon Yard in fall 2018,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/13/16296066/terrain-gardens-renderings-urbn-wedding-venue,article,"There is no shortage of beautiful venues to get hitched here in Philly, but we have a feeling the new Terrain Gardens on the Main Line will take the cake when it opens next year.URBN Food and Beverage, the same folks behind the Pinterest-perfect terrain in Glen Mills, have announced that its new venue Terrain Gardens is expected to open in fall 2018 at the lifestyle center Devon Yard, which is currently under construction. Terrain Gardens started accepting bookings this week for events starting September 1, 2018 and beyond. Expect all of the carefully curated and lush spaces one would expect from the same designers behind terrain. David Ziel, URBN’s chief development officer, says the 150-person event space will be “unlike any other in the area.” There will be four spaces, including a reception room, a garden porch, a ceremony garden, and a bridal suite. The design emphasizes merging the indoors with the outdoors. Think reclaimed barn wood floors, lots of twinkling lights, plants galore, and food catered by Jeff Michaud, a James Beard award winner. When Terrain Gardens opens next fall, it will be one of various URBN ventures at Devon Yard. There will be an Anthropologie, a terrain, and an Amis Trattoria restaurant. "
10-story Hamilton tower breaks ground in Logan Square,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/12/16293888/hamilton-tower-project-logan-square-groundbreaking,article,"The $82 million first phase of the Hamilton, a mixed-use residential development planned for a parking lot in Logan Square, officially broke ground today at 15th and Hamilton streets at a demolition party. Developers, city officials, and the Community College of Philadelphia traded the traditional shovels and dirt for demo tools and brick to mark the official start of construction on the $150 million, multi-phase project at 440 N. 15th Street. The first phase will build upon the current 1940s Inquirer warehouse that’s already on the site. Although portions of the 1940s warehouse will be demolished, some of it will be adaptively reused and turned into underground parking. David Yeager of Radnor Property Group says this cost-saving measure “can lower our price point so that we can really deal with more reasonably priced housing.”The Hamilton is a public-private partnership (P3s) project between the Community College of Philadelphia (CCP) and Radnor Property Group, which most recently finished up a similar P3s project with Drexel University with the Vue32. Dr. Donald Guy Generals, president of the CCP, said at the demolition ceremony that the community college decided to bring in a residential component to the school because “the opportunity to live by campus is an extremely positive advantage for students’ success.” Generals added that the mixed-use project will also help activate what’s long been an underutilized corridor in the Logan Square neighborhood. Already today, the area around the Hamilton project has seen a rapid rise in development, with Hanover North Broad mid-rises a couple of blocks away and the 32-story Alexander tower also nearing completion. The Hamilton’s 600 market-rate units, a mix of efficiency studio, 1-bedroom, and 2-bedroom apartments, will be geared toward international students and young professionals. Some units will come fully furnished, and residents will be able to use an in-house roommate matching service if they want. Phase 1 will include 279 units and the amenities build-out, which will include a fitness room, library, game room, conference center, a coffee bar, and a interior courtyard. Because the site is already zoned for CMX-4, construction has been fast-tracked, Yeager says. The first phase is expected to finish up in August 2018. The development will also aim to activate Hamilton and 15th streets with ground-floor retail. Yeager described it as a “foodie place” for the public. The second phase will follow with a 16-story tower on what’s currently a parking lot, with 320 more units and a community roof deck. The taller tower will enclose the private courtyard."

West Philly Local reports that new plans for 4125-23 Chestnut Street were presented to the Spruce Hill Neighborhood Association last week, calling for 130 prefab apartments at what’s currently a Wash ‘N Lube. The meeting was mostly informational, since the site is zoned CMX-4 and the project can be built by-right.It’s a big change from the previous owner’s original plans, which called for a 17-story tower with 240 units; a series of bonuses would have made way for the building to be more than three times its allowed height. But after community pushback, the developer ditched the tower plans. Vaughan Buckley will now build the six-story structure. Vaughan Buckley, which has built dozens of other modular developments in Spruce Hill and throughout Philly, now plans to build a much-shorter, by-right project instead. Although it will not require any zoning variances, it will have to go through the Civic Design Review process. Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Vaughan Buckley purchased this property for $5.4 million. Buckley is the general contractor. We regret the error. "
Philly wants to bring Amazons HQ here. But where?,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/7/16267600/amazon-new-headquarters-philadelphia-proposal,article,"Welcome to Open Threads, wherein we'll pass the mic to readers to speak up about topics of interest, distress, horror, and more. This week’s topic: Where in Philly should Amazon build its new headquarters?On Thursday, Amazon dropped some major news that set cities, including Philly, in a tizzy: The big-time online retailer announced it is looking to build its second headquarters in a U.S. city and metro of more than one million people. The plan calls for a headquarters that could cost $5 billion and will house at least 50,000 employees. The development would be on par with its current Seattle headquarters, which totals 8.1 million square feet. No doubt many cities like Philly will be vying for this opportunity. Mayor Jim Kenney said in a punny way that he plans to offer up Philly for consideration. We think Philadelphia would be a PRIME location for Amazon that would make people SMILE! Look forward to submitting a proposal! https://t.co/l60Wn5BVdgLauren Cox, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office, confirmed to Curbed Philly that the City of Philadelphia does indeed plan to submit an official proposal to Amazon by the October 19 deadline. But she acknowledged that Philly will no doubt face some tough competition. “Obviously this is going to be a very competitive process,” Cox said. But Philly does offer some advantages over other cities, she continued, ticking off a list of the city’s assets: “Philadelphia would provide them with a perfectly located East Coast hub where they have access to a rapidly growing millennial talent pool. We’re also much more affordable than other nearby east coast cities with similar population sizes.”But where exactly could Amazon set up shop? There’s always the Navy Yard, or around Grays Ferry where Pennovation is located. Or perhaps it would be well-suited among the eds and meds in University City, somewhere in the future Schuylkill Yards or uCity Square innovation hubs. There’s also plenty of vacant and industrial land in North Philly and parts of southwest Philly that could be brought back to life. So let’s take it to a poll! Consider these locations just a jumping off point—if you have any more ideas or thoughts about why Philly would (or wouldn’t?) be a good choice for Amazon’s new headquarters, please feel free to take it to the comments.

West Mt. Airy church gets new life as circus school,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/7/16266124/philadelphia-school-circus-arts-church-adaptive-reuse,article,"In what might be the first adaptive reuse project of its kind here in Philly, the defunct St. Madeleine Sophie Church in West Mt. Airy is set to re-open its doors this month serving a new kind of congregation—circus performers. After what executive director Shana Kennedy called “an exhaustive property search,” the Philadelphia School of Circus Arts has announced that it will headquartered at the 1930s church, located on a three-acre campus at 6452 Greene Street. It will also be home to Circadium, the first school in the U.S. to offer a diploma of circus arts, and Give and Take Jugglers.Shana and Greg Kennedy bought St. Madeleine Sophie Church for $1.2 million in August. The 28,000-square-foot property includes the sanctuary, a gym, the school building, a small home on the property, and a gatehouse. Phase one of the $80,000 renovations have been underway since this summer. Within the 5,000-square-foot sanctuary—one of the standout structures on the three-acre campus— and its 40-foot-tall ceilings will be a viewing gallery and trampoline classes. Below the sanctuary is the gym, which will be used for aerial training and performances. The historic Manor House that’s also on the property will be the main headquarters for the Give and Take Jugglers program. Here, tight wires will be installed along the home’s lawn. But one doesn’t need to be a world-class juggling act to set foot on the new circus arts campus. The Philadelphia School of Circus Arts will also have 100-plus classes open to the general public. The grand opening weekend will be September 15-17. "
Slim condo tower at Broad and Pine gets OK from design committee,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/6/16256856/broad-and-pine-condo-tower-civic-design-review-recap,article,"The proposed condo tower for Broad and Pine just cleared its latest development hurdle after receiving the green light from the Civic Design Review committee at Tuesday’s meeting. The committee voted unanimously to conclude the project’s CDR process. The CDR is a non-binding advisory committee of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. The tower was designed by Cecil Baker + Partners (Baker is on the commission, but recused himself from the discussion) and is being developed by Dranoff Properties. Original plans called for a hotel, but Dranoff later decided to build a 28-story condo tower with 56 condos, a 92-car underground parking garage, and 2,900 square feet of ground-floor retail. At the meeting, architect Nancy Bastian offered a few more details regarding how the condo tower will be broken up by floor. The first three floors will feature retail and a third-floor amenity level. Floors four through 17 will feature three units per floor, each with their own south-facing balconies. As the tower ascends past the University of the Arts building next door, floors 17 through 25 will feature two units per floor with north-facing balconies looking toward the Center City skyline. The two top floors will include two penthouses: One unit will take up the entire 26th floor and another two-story penthouse will set up shop on the 27th and 28th floors. In addition, the developer and designer are continuing to work with the Philadelphia Streets Department on proposed improvements to the narrow Watts Street, which the back of the proposed condo tower will face. Here, there will be access in and out of the tower’s underground parking garage. The committee praised the design for the proposed limestone base, its goal for LEED certification, and for the inclusion of underground parking. In addition to nearly two parking spaces per unit, there will also be 34 bike spaces and bike racks at least along Pine Street.  The original design proposal was first revealed in late August to the Washington Square West Civic Association, which supports the 361-foot-tall project, especially its plan to eliminate the large curb cuts on both Broad and Pine streets. However, a representative for the community group did express concern about the tower’s construction timeline at the Civic Design Review meeting: “We understand this project may follow the project for SLS, and we strongly urge that the current building not be demolished until construction. Philadelphia lots sometime sit vacant for way too long.”The Civic Design Review committee also concluded the process for a new research building for Penn’s Wharton School at 3601-37 Spruce Street and a replacement facility for Belmont Behavioral Hospital at 4200 Monument Road.

Developer scraps plans for mid-rise tower at Society Hills ACME,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/5/16254450/society-hill-acme-apartment-building-nixed,article,"Plans to build a mid-rise residential tower on top of the ACME in Society Hill have been scrapped, after months of opposition from the community. PlanPhilly reported last week that developer Alterra Property Group has abandoned its plans to build by-right a 53-foot-tall residential tower at 5th and South, currently the site of an ACME. The tower would have included 65 residential units, 43 parking spaces, and a retail grocer on the ground floor. But when the development was first announced in January of this year, the size and scope of the project was met with heavy opposition from the Society Hill Civic Association. For the past few months the developer and neighbors have been trying to come to an agreement. According to the PlanPhilly report, Alterra and the neighborhood have agreed to another 10-year lease of ACME and an expansion of the store. In addition, the neighbors said they will withhold opposition of a CVS replacing the stores across the street from ACME. "
The historic Edwin Forrest house on North Broad is for sale,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/5/16254554/philadelphia-edwin-forrest-mansion-for-sale,article,"Looking to own a piece of history on North Broad? A historic brownstone mansion next to the New Freedom Theatre has hit the market to the tune of $3.5 million. The original structure at 1326-46 N. Broad Street dates back to about 1853 and was the home of renowned actor Edwin Forrest. In later years, it served as the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, until it expanded and ultimately became the New Freedom Theatre, serving the city’s African-American community and training actors such as Leslie Odom, Jr., who would go onto star in Broadway’s Hamilton. But the listing only includes the historic mansion, which runs from N. Broad to Carlisle streets, listing agent Ryan McManus clarified to Curbed Philly.  Per the listing, “approximately 14,790 SF of lot coverage is available for redevelopment, along with the existing historic structure.” It’s zoned CMX-4. And while the theater building itself is not included in this sale, McManus said it could be considered for the right terms and price. The sale of the historic brownstone comes at a time of immense growth for this stretch of North Broad, which is right by Temple’s campus. Next door, there are plans for a 17-story residential tower designed by Cecil Baker + Partners. Next to that is the historic Blue Horizon boxing venue, which is also under consideration for redevelopment. "
"Hotel out, 28-story condo tower in at Broad and Pine [Update]",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/23/16188904/broad-and-pine-condo-tower-dranoff-cecil-baker,article,"Plans for the northeast corner of Broad and Pine have changed significantly, swapping out a 23-story hotel for a 28-story residential tower with 56 condos and a 92-car underground parking garage. Developer Carl Dranoff and architect Cecil Baker have teamed up again after One Riverside on the Schuylkill, and are planning to build a by-right, 361-foot-tall condo building on the corner of Broad and Pine. Currently, the corner is home to a Starbucks and parking garage. Baker and representatives for Dranoff Properties presented their plans to the Washington Square West Civic Association on Tuesday night ahead of a September 5 Civic Design Review. When Dranoff first presented plans for the site in 2015, the proposal called for a 78-room boutique hotel and apartment building. But Dranoff Properties says the new proposal, which is less dense and offers for sale condos, will provide a “less transitory” population and less traffic congestion surrounding the neighborhood. The design has also changed substantially, with Baker creating a skinnier, taller, and metal-clad building—“something that was not a glass tower,” he said. The taller tower is the result of the 11-foot, 9-inch tall ceilings in each condo unit, which will average about 2,500 square feet. The redesign also calls for retail on the ground floor and an amenity level on the second level. Watts Street, which sits behind the proposed condo tower, will be widened in order to allow cars to drive in and out of the underground parking garage. At the neighborhood meeting, one member asked why the condo tower needed nearly two parking spaces for every unit, especially given the walkability of the neighborhood.Baker said in his experience, many luxury condo residents have more than one car and more often than not use the parking garages for storage. Residents in attendance at the meeting also questioned the construction timeline of the project and how it will coincide with Dranoff’s other condo-hotel project, SLS Hotel & Residences the next block over at Broad and Spruce. Dranoff Properties said the current plan is to begin work on SLS first, followed by the Broad and Pine condo tower. SLS construction should begin by the end of the year or early 2018, as long as the developer is awarded its requested $19 million RACP state grant. The construction timeline on this 45-story tower is approximately two and a half years. Once SLS is complete, Dranoff Properties will begin demolition on the current structure at Broad and Pine and build the condo tower from the ground up. Construction is estimated to take about 28 months. Update: A demolition permit for the site was issued by Licenses & Inspections (L&I) on August 29. But the developer does have a deadline for the Broad and Pine tower. The CMX-5 zoning variance it acquired in 2015 includes a sunset provision that requires construction permits to be in hand by 2020. If the SLS hotel is delayed again, Dranoff Properties said it would consider starting construction on the Broad and Pine tower first in order to meet the variance’s 2020 deadline.However, the team stressed that the project is still in the early stages, so it could not provide any concrete timelines. The design proposal now goes to the Civic Design Review committee on September 5. "
"Inside Level 28, FMC Towers private lifestyle club in the sky",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/28/16201668/fmc-tower-level-28-pool-terrace-photos,article,"It took a few extra months, but the swanky Level 28 amenity club at AKA University City in the FMC Tower is finally ready for its closeup. Developers Brandywine Realty Trust and AKA announced this week the completion of the 25,000-square-foot Level 28, located on the 28th floor of the 49-story tower and designed by BLTa and interior designer Lissoni Associati. It’s a lesson in luxury, with amenities like a stainless steel indoor pool, and wine-tasting lounge, and a large fitness center that has some of the tallest views of Center City from University City. “We wanted to curate the experience of live, work, and play while at the same time creating a vertical neighborhood,” said president of AKA Larry Korman at the opening of Level 28 last week. To make that happen, Korman, Brandywine Realty Trust CEO Jerry Sweeney, and the Lissoni Associati team ensured that Level 28 provided a level of high-tech and high-design details that would “rival New York and LA,” according to Korman.What’s more, Level 28 is open not only guests of the tower’s AKA suites, but also to FMC Tower tenants (starting at $125 a month) and the public (for $200 to $300 a month). Think of Level 28, Korman says, as a private lifestyle club. The fitness center features equipment like Peloton Cycle bikes that face the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Schuylkill River and the Center City skyline. There’s also a golf simulator room next door where you can wack golf balls at the screen for $25 an hour or take a private lesson from Union League Golf Club instructor. A 16-seat movie theater is also on the floor—we’re told it’s seen the most use during the weekly viewings of HBO’s Game of Thrones.And because FMC Tower is also an office building, Level 28 also has a business suite. It doubles as a private tasting room that’s serviced by the new Walnut Street Cafe located at street level. But perhaps one of the most compelling spots on Level 28 is the 5,000-square-foot terrace, designed by Ground Reconsidered. Located 400 feet above street level, the terrace is walled-in and surrounded by native grasses and foliage, offering a peek of the Center City skyline and long views north. Here, wine and cocktails will be served nightly, also by Walnut Street Cafe. Take a tour of the private lifestyle club below. "
RFQ issued for 4601 Market after Philly police scrap move,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/24/16197024/request-for-qualifications-4601-market-philadelphia,article,"Months after the City of Philadelphia scrapped plans to move its police headquarters to West Philly, the future of the 4601 Market Street building now remains in the hands of a developer. A Request for Qualifications (RFQ) has been issued by the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) for the 15-acre site at 4601 Market Street, which includes the massive six-story, 325,000-square-foot Provident Mutual Life Insurance Building. “The availability of this key site provides a rare opportunity to create a unique, new destination in West Philadelphia,” the RFQ states. The current site, which includes two parcels, is zoned Commercial Mixed-Use (CMX3). It’s also located at a four-way intersection that includes the 46th Station stop on the Market-Frankford Line and an ALDI grocery store. PIDC’s request, which is on behalf of the City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia Authority For Industrial Development (PAID), comes about three months after the city announced it would no longer move its police headquarters and health services to 4601 Market Street. Instead, it’s setting up shop at the old Inquirer building on North Broad. This decision came after the city already sunk $50 million into restoring and renovating the historic Provident Mutual Life Insurance Building. In response, a trio of West Philly neighborhood organizations recently urged Mayor Jim Kenney in a letter to “make good on its commitment to redevelop 4601 Market Street in a timely matter” and to make sure that the community be engaged in the process “and not left in the dark about decisions.” The RFQ states that it’s open to any development programs that benefit “the surrounding community.” It also suggests a project that “could include adding public circulation through the site, utilizing green stormwater and landscaping elements, creating active and welcoming uses along the ground floor, and creating a welcoming environment for pedestrians along the public rights of way.”There will be a mandatory tour of 4601 Market Street on Wednesday, September 27, 2017 at 10 a.m. for interested developers. Proposals are due by Wednesday, November 01, 2017. "
Bala Cynwyd embarks on $100M master plan for historic corridor,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/24/16183392/bala-avenue-master-plan-mixed-use-development,article,"With boarded up shops and vacant spaces lining the corridor, it’s safe to say that it’s been decades since anyone has enjoyed a stroll down Bala Avenue in Bala Cywnyd. In its defense, the Bala Avenue is relatively short, spanning just three blocks between. And yet, in its heyday, it was a bustling retail corridor with an architecturally stunning theater at its core. Today, it’s mostly frequented by speeding cars looking to bypass traffic along Montgomery Avenue and City Avenue. “It’s beautiful fundamentally, but there aren’t many reasons to take time to walk along it at the moment,” says Bobby Fijan, a partner at Cross Properties. “We’re hoping to change that.”For the past year or so, local developer Cross Properties has been quietly acquiring more than a dozen parcels up and down Bala Avenue. Just this week it announced its $100 million master plan to bring some life back to the street with three major mixed-use developments in the works. Bobby says one reason his team was attracted to the site was because the bones and history of the corridor were already there. In the early 1900s, Bala Avenue was what nearby City Avenue or Bryn Mawr Avenue is today: A popular shopping district and retail hub. But as attention focused on building up other nearby corridors in later decades, Bala Avenue was largely forgotten. Many of the shops along the avenue have spent the past two or three decades vacant.“This is a revitalization of a shopping area that was meant to be there,” Fijan says. “We’re revitalizing something that was there to begin with.”The first phase of revitalization efforts has been underway since this past spring, with Cross Properties focusing on construction of the mixed-use development 10 Union. This 109-unit, four-story development is being built from the ground up and will be the first of three major mixed-use projects proposed for what the developer is calling the “NoBa” district. If the developer gets zoning approval, two more mixed-use projects will follow, including 202 Bala and 1 Cynwyd. The first phase is expected to bring a total of 240 units and 20,000 square feet of retail to the neighborhood. That’s a lot of residential for an already established and well-off town, where the median income is $113,462. But Fijan says given that Bala Cynwyd is the closest suburb to Philly—the Bala station is the first stop on the Cynwyd SEPTA rail line—there’s a market for a wide-range of demographics who want to be close to Philly, but perhaps live in an area that offers a small-town feel. He points to towns even farther from Philly that have found success with similar mixed-use redevelopments with walkability at their core. “There’s vitality in places like downtown West Chester, Phoenixville, and Wayne,” Fijan says. “We’re trying to create that on a smaller scale in the closest community that exists to Philadelphia.”"
Amtraks 30th Street Station is looking for a master developer ,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/24/16190880/amtrak-rfq-30th-street-station-philadelphia,article,"Amtrak is wasting no time starting work on its multi-billion dollar 30th Street Station District plan. But first, it needs a developer. Amtrak has taken another step forward by issuing a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) this week in search of a master developer to help lead the ambitious multi-billion dollar project, which includes the redevelopment of 30th Street Station itself and 18 million square feet of new development around it, including a new neighborhood and 40 acres of green space.Rina Cutler, Amtrak’s senior director of major station planning and development said in the announcement, “We are seeking an innovative partner who understands the vision for Philadelphia, respects the surrounding neighborhoods, and is excited to partner on a plan that will significantly improve the experience for all travelers, while maximizing the value of our strategic assets.”Some 4 million Amtrak passengers travel through 30th Street Station each year, making it Amtrak’s third busiest station in its entire system. That number is only projected to increase—ridership is expected to double by 2040—For years, it has been developing a master plan to improve the station itself and its surrounding properties, culminating into the 30th Street Station District plan. Already, Amtrak has received a large amount of interest from developers. Nearly 150 people attended a presentation on the master developer partnership in late July. Here’s the timeline on the whole process: The 30th Street Station District Plan itself is a 35-year plan."
Inside King of Prussias $1 billion transformation,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/22/16084002/king-of-prussia-development-boom,article,"If King of Prussia builds it, will they—millennials, baby boomers, and commuters—come? Eric Goldstein likes to think so. The executive director of the King of Prussia Business District has spent the past six years spearheading efforts to turn King of Prussia’s reputation as a mega-mall to a place where people actually want to live. “When I came to King of Prussia in 2011, what I saw was amazing,” said Goldstein. “King of Prussia is a true edge city, which is a town that is outside of the region’s downtown, but has an economy that’s so large and stands on its own—that’s absolutely true of King of Prussia.” So far, Goldstein’s efforts seem to be working quite well. In the last few years, $1 billion has been invested into King of Prussia, which sits just 20 miles outside of Philly. Businesses have moved their headquarters here and developers have built up vacant land with mixed-use projects, and national retailers have set up shop in the area’s new town center.But by all accounts, King of Prussia is only just getting started. Thousands square feet of development is currently under construction, with even more in the pipeline. Here are some of the most transformational projects changing King of Prussia, turning it into a shopping haven to a suburban live-work-play hub. Arguably the most highly-anticipated project for King of Prussia is also the most ambitious and long-time coming: The King of Prussia Rail Line. Spearheaded by SEPTA, this effort to connect King of Prussia with the Norris High Speed Line (NHSL) has been years in the making, and there are still plenty more years to go. “It has amazing potential,” says Goldstein, whose organization helped launch the KOP Rail Coalition. “And it was amazing to me that King of Prussia was able to get itself to where it is today without public transportation. That was shocking to me in 2011 and still is in 2017.”The project has been marked as high priority by SEPTA, and it’s been pegged as the shot in the arm for King of Prussia, which for decades has been snarled in traffic and congestion, given its location sandwiched between four highways. The hope, says Goldstein, is that the KOP Rail will not only take more cars off the road, but also encourage more mixed-use development around the future transit hub and thereby convince commuters to stay put. “The people going between Philadelphia and University City, or even Main Line will have this option that will sure beat sitting on the Schuylkill,” says Goldstein. If all goes to plan, the area could have an operational train by 2025. 251 Dekalb is one of the largest redevelopment residential projects in the region, spanning 26 acres in King of Prussia. With the help of Varenhorst Architects, developer Candlebrook Properties just finished a complete overhaul of the property’s five modern residential buildings, transforming 641 units into a ultra-luxurious apartments with midcentury modern and minimalist finishes.At the development, it’s clear to see that 251 Delkab is drawing both young professionals and young families to its grounds (the free La Colombe coffee every day is just one of the community perks). Josh Levy, managing director and head of acquisitions and development for Candlebrook Properties says the renovated apartments fill a gap in the rental market that King of Prussia had been sorely missing for years. “We’re already seeing families come and live here,” he says. “The anticipation is that [...] as millennials expand their families and leave urban environments, but don’t necessarily want to become homeowners, this kind of environment is the environment for them.” The rental market expanding all over the area, with a number of other developments following in Dekalb’s footsteps. Ave King of Prussia will bring 275 luxury apartments (some of them furnished for corporate use) in January 2018. Meanwhile, Park Square will bring an additional 320 high-end rentals to the King of Prussia business park. Drawing millennials to its town limits isn’t King of Prussia’s only mission—it also wants to help baby boomers stick around, too. At least, that’s the goal of Bozzuto Group’s new Canvas Valley Forge development, which is specifically catered to adults aged 55 and older who want to “simplify” their lives.It’s the first development of its kind for Bozzuto, which decided to embark on this type of project based on years of research studying this demographic. Although one Freddie Mac survey found that young baby boomers hope to stay in their current homes, 40 percent suspect they may move at least one more time before retirement. Bozzuto’s banking on that group to make their move to King of Prussia. When the 232-unit apartment development opens in the fall, it will offer its older tenants a long list of resort-style amenities that were specifically chosen based on their demographic: Everything from an in-house salon to an inner courtyard with a pool to a game room equipped with Wii bowling.The hope is that Canvas helps make the transition from homeowner to renter more accommodating and manageable for these young baby boomers, said Pete Sikora, The Bozzuto Group’s development manager. But perhaps one of the most surprising transformations in the area has been that of the King of Prussia Town Center. The 260,000-square-foot town center, just steps from the numerous residential developments like Canvas, has given the area its first so-called Main Street and drawn national restaurants and retail to the area. The KOP Town Center opened only last year in July 2016, but it is already 90 percent leased, including big names like Founding Farmers and Honeygrow. Just last week, CBRE announced seven new tenants that plan to open here. Says Goldstein, “Where the game used to be was at the King of Prussia Mall. Now, we have the KOP Town Center, which has really injected a whole new life of retail that wouldn’t necessarily go into a mall.”It’s not just food and clothes that have turned the center into a popular spot for out-of-town businesses and residential. Though still home to 2,100 parking spaces, the town center offers the King of Prussia one of its first tastes of walkability, says Goldstein. And along with the restaurants and retail, there’s a public space in the center, which has played host to plenty of programming like outdoor concerts and yoga classes. Says Goldstein, “The center has also infused energy and vibe into the town that never had a downtown.” "
Eastern Tower Community Center secures $22.5M construction loan,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/21/16179006/chinatown-eastern-tower-construction-loan-philadelphia,article,"The long-awaited 20-story Eastern Tower Community Center just secured a $22.5 million construction loan, just as the site itself at 10th and Vine begins to show some signs of life.  Citizens Bank announced today that it has provided developer Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC) with the multi-million dollar construction financing for the project. The $22.5 million sum is the largest loan involved in the financing of the project.Just last month PCDC announced that total funding had been secured for the $76 million project, giving general contractor Hunter Roberts the green light to begin construction. A recent visit to the site on Monday revealed construction equipment already at work on the site. A fence now surrounds the lot and the parking lot itself has been torn up, making space for the future tower. The announcement also revealed a few more key details about the Eastern Tower Community Center, which has been in the works since 2011. There will be: Although it’s clear that construction has begun at the site, an official groundbreaking is expected to take place this fall. "
Sneak Peek: Phillys new Aloft Hotel in the old  Liberty Title building,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/21/16163150/aloft-philadelphia-downtown-hotel-liberty-title-building-photos,article,"After more than a year of renovations, the historic Liberty Title building is ready to return to North Broad as a 179-room Aloft Hotel. As construction crews made some last-minute touches to the hotel ahead of its August 31 grand opening, Curbed Philly got a preview of what’s to come, from millennial-friendly amenities to modern hotel rooms with sweeping city views. “We’re thrilled to be able to rescue a building as beautiful as this,” said general manager Evan Glenn Evans. “There’s just soul and character here that you can’t always get in a new build.” The Liberty Title building dates back to the 1920s when it opened as the headquarters for the bank Liberty Title and Trust Company. Designed by Savery & Scheetz, the 21-story building has had various owners over its long history. But its final tenant, the Philadelphia Water Department, left the premises in the 1990s and the building remained vacant ever since. Developers Realen Properties and HRI properties finally purchased the property in 2016 and embarked on the hotel redevelopment project at 101 N. Broad Street. Its prominent location—a block from City Hall and next to the Convention Center—is what attracted the developers to the site. In fact, the hotel will have a direct connection to the Convention Center. Today, the 181,000-square-foot hotel mixes the old with the new. Evans says the goal with the new hotel is to create a comfortable atmosphere within a grand, historic building with an eye toward the traveling millennial. “Not stuffy, but comfortable,” he emphasized. The old-world details are immediately evident past the front doors, where the lobby’s soaring ceiling and massive, 30-foot-tall windows greet visitors. “I think it’s the most dramatic hotel experiences in the city,” said Evans, who has previously worked at the other hospitality venues throughout Philly, including the Westin Philadelphia, One Liberty Observation Deck, and the nearby Le Meridian. This impressive space is where much of the building’s original architecture remains on display. Of the developers’ favorite details are the “monumental windows” that look out to its neighboring City Hall, Masonic Temple, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. The team also preserved and restored the original plaster details and crown molding that lines the lobby’s ceilings. The original marble flooring with mosaic tiling also remain.  But coupled with the old-world details are more modern and playful finishes, including midcentury modern furniture, a floor-to-ceiling bookcase, and a WXYZ bar that will be open to the public and serve drinks and light bites. This modern style continues in the hotel’s 179 rooms, which range in size from 206 to 423 square feet and all come equipped with Netflix and Hulu accounts. There’s a work desk in each room, and nearly all of them are designed to offer city views from their original windows. The Aloft Philadelphia Downtown is scheduled to open on August 31. Prices start at $179 per night. There is the grand opening offer for 17 percent off the best available rate."
"Gallery Mall redevelopment shifts gears with new name, new retailers",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/17/16162196/gallery-mall-fashion-district-philadelphia-update,article,"The Gallery Mall redevelopment is still very much a construction zone on Market Street, but its developers are already revamping the project, starting with a name change: Goodbye, Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia. Hello, Fashion District Philadelphia. Now, new plans call for retailers like H&M, which will open its largest store in the region here and—wait for it—a dine-in movie theater that has reclining seats. The Inquirer first reported that the project’s co-developers PREIT and Macerich decided to go in another direction with the $365 million project, moving away from outlet retailers to a more mixed-use take with both retail, restaurants, and entertainment. A statement from Fashion District Philadelphia to Curbed Philly said: Based on strong retail demand among flagship brands, in addition to designer outlets, the project name was changed to Fashion District Philadelphia to reflect the more expansive mix of retail, entertainment and dining that is driving this game-changing venture. [...] The new name, Fashion District Philadelphia, reflects that sentiment and shift in tenant mix, along with a new fashion district this project will bring to this city.Philly is woefully lacking in movie theaters, save for a number of smaller venues like the Ritz Five in Society Hill (which is slated for redevelopment). University City is also home to a small movie theater that offers dining and drinking options. There will still be some outlets at the Fashion District, the statement clarified. Burlington Coat Factory, which is already located nearby on Market Street, also plans to move into a new space in the Fashion District of Philadelphia. This big shift comes months after major construction began on the redevelopment at the end of 2016. The renovation of the 1,400,000-square-foot project will make it the largest retail repositioning project in the region. When all is said and done by late 2018, the project will span three city blocks."
1700 Market in Center City begins $7M facelift,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/17/16157714/1700-market-philadelphia-renovations,article,"After acquiring 1700 Market for nearly $200 million last year, a San Francisco developer is about to give the Center City high-rise a $7 million facelift. Shorenstein Properties, the new owner of the office tower, has announced that it has begun the first phase of renovations at 1700 Market. Led by construction company D’Lauro and Rodgers Inc., the project is expected to finish up in March 2018. 1700 Market was built in 1968, so the building could use some updating. The first phase renovations will mostly focus on amping up the 32-story tower’s curb appeal, said Chris Caltabiano, senior vice president of asset management at Shorenstein Properties LLC, in a statement.The design upgrades by New York-based Gertler & Wente Architects will include new exterior signage and lighting, new interior lighting and ceilings, and new glass entranceway and doors. Wood accent walls and Terrazzo flooring will also be part of the lobby’s makeover. The goal is for the renovations to help modernize the building and improve tenants’ experience, said Caltabiano. Down the road, the renovation will also include the addition of a conference center, a fitness center, and a roof terrace."
Project HOMEs LGBTQ housing moves forward in North Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/17/16157284/project-home-lgbtq-affordable-housing-north-philly,article,"After a bit of a bidding war emerged for large plot of land in North Philly, some of which was originally intended for an affordable housing project, a bankruptcy judge is set to approve the sales of a portion of the properties to Project HOME. On Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Magdeline D. Coleman said she would approve the sales of the now-bankrupt North Philadelphia Health System’s properties at Eighth Street and Girard Avenue for a combined $10.25 million, according to the Inquirer. Ironstone Real Estate Partners will acquire the majority of land for $8.5 million, while Project HOME will pay $1.7 million for additional parcels. In a statement to Curbed Philly, Annette Jeffrey, Project HOME’s vice president of development and communications said, “We are deeply grateful for this outcome.” For years, Project HOME has had plans to build an affordable housing project geared toward at-risk LGBTQ youth on the site. The non-profit organization had already raised $13.5 million from state grants, the city, and private money. But multiple bids came in for the properties in June, forcing the site to go to bid on August 11. Securing the property will allow Project HOME move forward on its two-phase project. The first phase will include 30 units of LGBTQ-friendly permanent housing for formerly homeless youth and those at risk. It will be the only housing of its kind in Pennsylvania, according to Jeffrey.The second phase will include 40 units of affordable housing for formerly homeless adults. Said Jeffrey, “Though Philadelphia is the poorest of all the major cities, we have the greatest chance to be the first major city to end and prevent homelessness. This victory brings us one step closer to achieving that goal.""The properties acquired by Iron Real Estate Partners will continue to function as a health and drug treatment centers. "
"For Merriam Theater renovations, addition of 32-story tower at play",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/15/16150188/merriam-theater-renovations-residential-tower,article,"Talks have begun for the Merriam Theater on South Broad Street to undergo a major and much-needed renovation, according to multiple reports. One big idea that’s floating around? Tacking on a 32-story tower onto it. That’s according to the Kimmel Center, which became owner of the Merriam Theater just last year when it purchased the property from the University of the Arts. The Kimmel Center told the Inquirer that it would team up with a developer to demolish a portion of the property and build a 32-story (probably residential) tower with new lobby spaces in its place. But these talks are all in the preliminary stages, according to the article. The Kimmel Center plans to solicit proposals from developers this week. It will also host a public meeting about the Merriam Theater renovations in September, says NewsWorks. The Merriam opened in 1918 on South Broad. The actual theater remains well-preserved, while its exterior has undergone multiple changes over the years. The plan is to keep the theater as is, but provide more legroom and space in general for the audience. Richard Maimon of Kieran Timberlake, which created the proposed design, said that the hope is that the renovation creates a new and improved experience for theatergoers: Maimon describes a newly configured building that gives theatergoers a different kind of experience: a clear façade that allows the public to see in and out, a double-height lobby, a grand stairway, the ability to access seats easily, modern amenities, and places for the audience to gather.As for the potential tower, it would potentially join a growing list of other tall residential projects that have been proposed nearby. Carl Dranoff’s 45-story SLS International Hotel & Residences is in the works a couple of blocks away, as well as another tower proposed for Broad and Pine. In addition, an RFQ has been issued for the Health Center No. 1 building also a short walk away from the Merriam. "
Poll: Which major Philly project needs to happen most?,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/11/16131010/poll-philadelphia-mega-project-most-important,article,"Welcome to Friday Open Threads, wherein we'll pass the mic to readers to speak up about topics of interest, distress, horror, and more. This week’s topic: Which big-time development does Philly need the most right now?Earlier this week, we released a cheat sheet of megadevelopments planned or already in the works for Philly. The full list of multi-billion dollar projects and smaller, but still significant developments shed light on Philly’s ever-changing skyline. Thought Philly was different today?

Historic Electric Factory building in Callowhill sold to local developer,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/10/16125036/electric-factory-building-sold,article,"A large building in Callowhill that’s home to the Electric Factory concert venue has a new owner: A local developer just purchased the property at 7th and Willow streets for $20.1 million, according to multiple reports. The Philadelphia Business Journal reports that Arts & Crafts Holdings inked a deal with with Callowhill Center Associates. The new owners of the building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, have no immediate details regarding their plans for the building, according to the Inquirer. Since 2015, Arts & Crafts Holdings has been buying up properties all around the fast-emerging Callowhill neighborhood, creating its own cluster of old factories that it refers to as the Spring Arts District. To date, it now owns more than a dozen properties in the neighborhood, many of which they’ve converted into residential, mixed-use, and creative offices. The Electric Factory building sale is a big deal for the local development company, as there were numerous interested buyers. Originally built in 1916, the seven-story structure originally served as the switchgear plant for General Electric. It was designated historic in 1985. "
Live!

On Wednesday, in a 7-0 vote the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board ruled in favor of Live! Hotel and Casino Philadelphia after other parties filed a lawsuit that challenged its ownership rules, NBC10 reported. The lawsuit, filed by SugarHouse Casino and Market East Associates, argued that one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed casino, Watche ""Bob"" Manoukian, would have an ownership interest that’s above the controlling interest limit of 33.3 percent. Manoukian already owns 85 percent stake of Parx Casino in Bensalem. But he had committed to transferring a $34 million interest in the South Philly project to a trust for his sons. PGCB rules in favor of legal ownership per gaming law of Phila Stadium Casino projectThe Gaming Board decided the financial structure was legit. While an appeal can still be filed within the next 30 days, all the project needs to begin construction is final approval from the Gaming Board. The casino has been in the works for years now.

Health Center No. 1 nominated for historic designation while development awaits,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/9/16118626/health-center-no-1-historic-register-nomination,article,"Health Center No. 1, a midcentury modern building that dates back to 1959 and is awaiting future development, has just been nominated for historic designation. NakedPhilly noticed the nomination form for Health Center No. 1 go up on the Philadelphia Historical Commission’s website this week. The Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia sent in the nomination on July 18, 2017. That’s a day after an RFP was issued by the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) for the 55,880-square-foot building at the corner of Broad and Lombard streets. Of the building, the PIDC wrote, “The City is willing to consider proposals that incorporate or relocate the existing City uses.”The health center was designed by Montgomery & Bishop in 1959 as one of 10 neighborhood health centers built in the city after World War II. The curvy building has long been a standout on the corner of Broad and Lombard, thanks to its teal-tiled facade—the bright colors were meant to lift the spirits of patients.The nomination argues that the building should be added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places because it is a work of art along the Avenue of the Arts and a neighborhood landmark and the building is a tell-tale example of the midcentury modern architecture. The nomination will first be considered by the Committee on Historic Designation, which will assess whether or not the building should be recommended for approval by the Historical Commission. Meanwhile, the development proposals are due to the PIDC by September 22.  "
Heres your Philly megadevelopment cheat sheet,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/9/16059724/philadelphia-megadevelopment-megaproject-list-information,article,"There’s a lot of talk about Philly’s growing skyline these days. Numerous cranes already dot the sky, and countless corners of the city have been transformed into construction sites. But as research shows, Philly’s skyline still has a long way to go compared to other major U.S. cities, like Chicago and New York. And developers are definitely noticing: There is approximately 2.1 million square feet of new construction underway that’s set to change Philly’s skyline. There are numerous projects in the works that are valued at $1 billion or more each. Many of what we’d call megaprojects will take years to complete, but some of them are set to debut as early as 2018. Here’s a look at some of the transformative developments that cost at least $1 billion.  These big-time projects will not only reshape the areas they’re being built in, but will also make a noticeable impact on the city’s skyline.On the rise since breaking ground in 2014, the Liberty Property Trust-developed Comcast Technology Center is set to be the shot in the arm for Philadelphia. Standing at 1,121 feet, the Foster+Partners designed tower will not only be Philly’s first supertall building, but also the tallest tower in the state of Pennsylvania and outside of New York City and Chicago. (Its sister tower, the 973-foot-tall Comcast Center that was built in 2008, will be dethroned and become the second tallest in the city.) The 60-story Comcast Technology Center is so close to topping off—nearly 150 feet of structure left to go—and is expected to open in 2018. When it does, it will be the home of Comcast’s tech gurus, as well as the company’s own CEO, who bought the only three condos available in the building on the 45th floor. Meanwhile, the upper levels of the tower will feature a Four Seasons Hotel, which will be the most highly situated hotel in the entire country. It’s a return for Four Seasons to Philadelphia; the hotel was originally located on Logan Square, and has since been replaced by the Logan Hotel. The city of Philadelphia and really the entire region is expecting a lot when Comcast Technology Center opens. It’s expected to bring in 4,000 new jobs, and on top of being the world-class, innovative headquarters for Comcast employees, it will also be a tourist attraction for the city, with multiple areas open to the public. The City of Philadelphia and a host of developers, designers, and transportation heads have embarked on an ambitious 35-year plan to create 18 million square feet of new development—including a new neighborhood and 40 acres of green space—all within University City. Amtrak and its long list of consultants have hosted numerous public open houses over the years, gathering community input and feedback on its plans for the 30th Street Station District. In 2016, it released the final master plan, based on months and months of feedback. Adjacent to the proposed Schuylkill Yards (more on that below), the 30th Street Station District has an incredibly long list of projects it plans to undertake, everything from improving traffic and pedestrian safety around 30th Street Station to building more public space around it to creating an entire neighborhood over the rail yards. Most recently, Amtrak hosted its last open house regarding the proposed Station Plaza around 30th Street Station and expects to issue bids for contractors later this year. Here’s the full 35-year timeline to help wrap your around the massive undertaking. The elaborate press conference alone announcing Schuylkill Yards in March 2016 was just the beginning of what’s in store for the Drexel University-Brandywine Realty Trust venture. The $3.5 billion development is set to transform 14 acres in University City into a leading innovation hub of the region, with eight high-rises, totaling 6.9 million square feet.First up: The groundbreaking of the 1.3-acre elliptical park called One Drexel Plaza. The public space is being built first as a sign of goodwill to the community. Brandywine Realty Trust is also announced its $5 million Neighborhood Engagement Initiative, which will address and fund five specific areas that neighbors of the future project have highlighted in past community meetings, from job growth to affordable housing to educational support. Drexel and Brandywine say that the entirety of Schuylkill Yards to expected to take 20 years, so this is a project Philly will be watching for a long, long time. Rounding out the billion-dollar (and higher) megadevelopment projects is uCity Square, which, as the name suggests, is also located in University City. With the January 2017groundbreaking of its first tower, 3675 Market, uCity Square is also positioning itself as becoming an innovation-driven district, similar to Schuylkill Yards. In total, it’s a 6,000,000-square-foot project. uCity Square has 2.5 million square feet of existing property, with another 350,000 square feet under construction. Yet another 3.65 million square feet is still in the pre-development stages. Within that 6 million-square-foot district will be two public spaces and the build-out of new roads that will better connect the development with the surrounding neighborhoods, such as Powelton Village. But given that the completion of uCity Square is way down the road, it has allowed University City District to build a temporary meadow on its construction site. The project is being developed by the University City Science Center and Wexford Science + Technology, which specializes in working with institutions to develop what it calls “Knowledge Communities.” This major multi-phase project has been in the works for some time by developer K4 LLC and architect Barton Partners. It covers 17 acres—almost all of the land between Washington Avenue and Reed Street—and will bring 10 residential high-rises totaling 2,000 units, 100 townhouses, and one 22-story hotel to the expansive site on the Delaware River near Pennsport.But the project has hit numerous speed bumps along the way. Most recently, a bill that would have allowed taller buildings to be constructed on the Delaware River waterfront has been delayed, with the developer planning to work with the neighborhood residents over the summer on the zoning bill and project’s future. Meanwhile, the project has applied for $44 million total in RACP state grants for the project. It remains to be seen if the state will grant its big ask. The University of Pennsylvania Hospital’s $1.5 billion project Penn Medicine Pavilion is the largest capital project in Penn’s history. It’s also arguably one of the most ambitious and interesting healthcare projects in the city right now. The Foster+Partners-designed, 1.5-million-square-foot building will stand 16 stories tall on the site of the former Penn Tower and be home to 500 new patient rooms and 47 operating rooms. Its summer concrete pour was the largest in the history of Philadelphia. Philadelphia’s historic Navy Yard has been booming with new development for years now, with more than $1 billion in both public and private investment. It all started when Urban Outfitters bought a property here for $1 and turned it into their massive headquarters. Today, the Navy Yard is home to 1,200 acres, housing some 150 companies and is drawing big-name designers like Bjarke Ingels and Field Operations to its projects. And it’s not over yet. The Navy Yard, largely developed by Liberty Property Trust, has long-term plans for more mixed-use developments that could mean that one day people will actually be able to live on campus. It has applied for a $5 million state grant for a mixed-use rehabilitation project that includes 36,000-square-feet of retail and commercial space and residential units. Philly’s development boom isn’t just about megaprojects that are shelling out billions of dollars. There are other smaller, but still significant developments in the works that will transform neighborhoods and the city itself. Some, like the major mixed-use project East Market, are already well underway, while others, like the Penn’s Landing capping, are still in the very beginning stages. The following projects represent developments that are worth $200 million or more. East Market, a 4-acre mixed-use development that will span an entire block between Market and Chestnut streets, is very much still under construction since its 2014 groundbreaking. But when all is said and done, the multi-phase project led by National Real Estate Development will bring 562 residential units between two towers and major retailers like Wawa, City Fitness, Iron Hill Brewery, Mom’s Organic Market, and the Design Center to the Market East corridor. Across the street from the East Market development will be the future Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, setting up shop in the former Gallery Mall. Already well under construction, Shoemaker and Skanska have been renovating about 1,400,000 square feet of both interior and exterior space, making it the largest retail repositioning project in the region. When construction finishes in August 2018, the PREIT-developed project will span three city blocks.When construction on the I-95 highway began in 1959, its intention was to serve as a connector between the suburbs and downtown Philadelphia and link the city’s riverfront on the Delaware with the airport. While it serves as a major mode of transportation, it has also cut off the riverfront from the rest of the city. The city plans to change the damage of I-95 by capping four acres of it and building an eight-acre park at Penn’s Landing. Also in store: 1,500 new housing units, 500 hotel rooms, and more than 100,000-square-feet of retail, restaurants, and entertainment. Total funding has been committed for the project, which is expected to finish construction in 2021.It’s been four years since developer Carl Dranoff announced his plans to build the 45-story SLS Philadelphia hotel and condo building right on Broad Street. While the wrecking ball has since razed the former Philadelphia International Records building, the site remains vacant as the project awaits the $19 million it applied for through the state’s RACP program. The project calls for 90 condominium residences, 152 hotel rooms, and 4,600 square feet of ground floor retail space. When completed, the tower will be the tallest ground-up residential building in Pennsylvania.If and when that money comes through, Dranoff, who most recently debuted the luxury condo high-rise One Riverside on the Schuylkill, will have sufficient funding to begin work on the project. Developer Chestlen Development is bringing two hotels to the corner site at 15th and Chestnut: A 295-room W Philadelphia and a 460-room Element Philadelphia Hotel. Clocking in a 51 stories, the tower broke ground in 2015 and at the time had one of the largest concrete pours in Philly’s history. It’s expected to open in spring 2018 and totals 770,607 square feet.One of the last remaining undeveloped lots on the Schuykill is expected to become home to two glassy, skinny towers designed by Gensler and developed by PMC Property Group. Dubbed River Walk, the proposal calls for two residential towers: A 32- and 28-story, totaling 600 total units. Most recently, the project cleared its latest hurdle: Extending a zoning permit that allows the developer to build the project by-right. The development is expected to break ground this year, though it is not clear if it will be a multi-phase project. Along with River Walk, PMC Property and Gensler are also make up the developer-design team behind Aramark’s big move to 2400 Market Street. Aramark’s announcement that it was staying put in September 2016 made big waves after rumors swirled that the big-time food service company was planning to move its headquarters out of Philadelphia. With construction well underway, the plan calls to transform the existing structure into a a modern, 600,000-square-foot, nine-story building. Aramark, the anchor tenant, will occupy the top five floors and 300,000 square feet of space. In keeping with the company’s green goals, the plan calls for 8,000 square feet of outdoor terraces that will look over the Schuylkill River. After years of tweaks and community meetings, one of the last-remaining vacant lots in Rittenhouse Square is going to be developed and transformed into 1911 Walnut. Developed by Southern Land Company and designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz Architecture, 1911 Walnut will be 47 stories tall with no more than 335 units, some of which will include mixed-income housing. Construction work is underway at the site, with the demolition of the Oliver H. Bair Funeral Home garage.Although the total project cost has not been divulged, Bart Blatstein’s massive mixed-use project planned for South Broad and Washington Avenue will undoubtedly bring big changes to the corridor whenever it breaks ground. Long a vacant eyesore, the 195,000-square-foot site was recently acquired by the developer for $20 million. He plans to build a 34-story tower with some 1,000 residential units, office space, and 160,000-square-feet of retail in what Blatstein has referred to as a “shopping village.” This project hasn’t come without its hurdles: Blatstein only recently bought the site, months after he had begun the design and zoning processes with the city. And neighbors have expressed concern about the scope and size of the project compared to the rest of the neighborhood. Blatstein, who has said, “I believe in this project 100 percent,” has not revealed a groundbreaking date yet. "
Historic Dilworth House on Washington Square still seeks development,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/8/16107242/dilworth-house-philadelphia-development-for-sale,article,"The owner of the historic Dilworth House on Washington Square has been trying to market the property for potential development, but to no avail. Owner and developer John Turchi Jr. “quietly” but “actively looking to see if there was a developer who would be willing to acquire the site and build it,” Turchi’s lawyer Philip S. Rosenzweig recently told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “Mr. Turchi is committed to the project. He has no intention of relinquishing.”The Dilworth House has stood at 225 S. Sixth Street since 1957. It was built for then-Mayor Richardson Dilworth, who moved into the home as a sign of his commitment to improve the neighborhood. But in recent years, the house and its location in a rapidly developing and pricey neighborhood has become a hot-button issue among neighbors and developers alike. When Turchi bought the house in 2001 for $1.75 million, he originally planned to tear it down and build a 16-story, Robert Venturi-designed condo in its place. A battle between preservationists and the developer brewed for years, until 2015 when Turchi was given the green light to partially tear down the building while maintaining the facade. But the site isn’t easy to build on—it requires six zoning overlays—, so many potential buyers have walked away from purchasing it, the Inquirer report noted. Meanwhile, the historic house has fallen into disrepair, and will continue to deterioriate until it finds a willing developer to do something with it. "
8th and Market site to remain a parking lotfor now,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/7/16099336/8th-and-market-philadelphia-future-development,article,"Despite the sheer amount of development and construction underway just down the street, the large parking lot at 8th and Market will remain that way—for now. Philadelphia Business Journal reports that the parking lot’s owner Goldenberg Group hopes to develop the site into something more, but not for another three years. On July 25, the Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) granted the developer’s request to receive a three-year extension on its parking lot permit, which allows for 292 parking spaces. The variance is needed because the site is zoned CMX-5, which allows for the highest and most dense development. The extension is set to expire on January 21, 2021. That’s when Goldenberg Group hopes a development deal will come up to turn the site into something more, with the idea that it’s one of the last remaining development sites on the Market East corridor. Goldenberg said: ""We believe the right project has to combine a fabulous retail and entertainment hub that activates the street frontage for pedestrians, with significant tower components that add vitality to the corridor and neighborhood.""By that point, both the two towers at the $600 million mixed-use development East Market and the renovation of the Gallery into the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia across the street will have opened.

59-home mixed-use development approved for Olde Kensington,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/3/16089142/cecil-b-moore-avenue-mixed-use-development-kensington,article,"A 147,742-square-foot mixed-use development is coming to the corner of North 5th Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue in Olde Kensington.Developer RiverWards Group received the green light from both the Civic Design Review committee and the zoning board this week to build 59 residential units with roof decks and commercial space at the site. The full project calls for: The site is zoned Industrial Residential Mixed-Use (IRMX). Although the project is heavy on the residential component, two mixed-use buildings facing N. 5th Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue will feature commercial space on the ground level and live-work spaces above. The site, however, is prone to flooding. At the Civic Design Review meeting on Tuesday, KJO Architecture and the developer said that stormwater management will be incorporated into the design. As for parking, the project is designed for just two curb cuts in the entire development. A two-way driveway that cuts through the center of the project will prevent any parking along the public street fronts. With the ZBA approval on Wednesday, developer Mo Rushdy tells Curbed Philly that the groundbreaking will be in late December, with the first set of homes to deliver in fall 2018.

The 87,789-square-foot development calls to replace a series of 1950s Norris Homes with 50 rental units, a mix of two-, three-, four-, and five-bedroom townhouses and one-bedroom apartments. These units were designed by KSK Architects, Planners, Historians to both blend in with the North Philly fabric of low-rises, as well as resemble market-rate townhouses being built throughout Philadelphia, said architect John R. Gibbons of KSK Architects.“It’s not meant to look like public housing,” Gibbons said. The design committee praised the project for using high-end materials, including brick, stone, and metal on the street-facing facades. They also appreciated that the project will strive for LEED Silver certification.But this attention to detail on the front exterior of the homes meant that most of the committee’s critiques were directed to the backs of the properties, which will be covered in vinyl. This area will feature small patches of communal spaces, 24 parking spaces, and individual storage sheds for each townhouse. There will also be a community building and 20 bicycle parking spaces on site. Gibbons said that the design team would love to use another type of material other than vinyl, but options are limited due to budgetary constraints. Committee member and landscape architect Tavis Dockwiller said, “When I see a space like this, I see opportunity.” She suggested creating a play space for kids, as well as more trees and design for the south-facing open space. The Civic Design Review committee is an advisory board, so all of their notes are considered recommendations. The board unanimously voted to conclude the design process. With the green light, the by-right project is expected to begin construction in January 2018 with an April 2019 completion date, according to PHA’s timeline. "
Neighbors begin talks on future of Frankford Chocolate Factory,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/1/16075224/frankford-chocolate-factory-development-meeting-recap,article,"Meetings of the South of South Neighborhood Association (SOSNA) typically draw a small crowd, but last night more than 200 concerned and curious neighbors, preservationists, and developers attended SOSNA’s preliminary meeting to consider potential uses of the Frankford Chocolate Factory at 2101 Washington Avenue. SOSNA representatives led the discussions, together with local real estate consulting firm U3 Ventures, local architect Cecil Baker, and two representatives of the owner group, Jake Ketchem and Anthony Nguyen.The 2.5-acre property, which occupies an entire city block and borders Graduate Hospital and Point Breeze, has been vacant for the past decade and was most recently purchased in November 2015 for $7.8 million. Ketchem and his brother had been looking for a site to build a large-scale climbing gym in Philadelphia, before hearing about the rare opportunity to buy the Washington Avenue property. Ketchem purchased the building with other investors, and the group is currently exploring development options. That’s why it decided to host a series of preliminary meetings with the community. Composed of a collection of buildings of various heights, footprints, and ages, the main L-shaped structure in the center of the property was originally built in 1865 to house the Howell & Brothers wallpaper company. In later evolutions, it was used by the American Can Company, as a John Wanamaker warehouse, and finally from the 1970s until 2006, by the Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company. It went on to become the biggest chocolate bunny manufacturing site in the world.The site currently bears I-2 zoning, which classifies its permitted use as a medium industrial district. The general consensus at the meeting was that the zoning should be changed to reflect a use more suitable to what is now a predominantly residential area.With other developers taking interest in Washington Avenue, such as Bart Blatstein’s recent purchase and anticipated development of the northeast corner lot of South Broad Street and Washington Avenue, the future use of 2101 Washington Avenue has the potential to play a key role in the new character of this formerly industrial corridor.“Washington Avenue is a blank slate—what should Washington Avenue be?” architect Cecil Baker asked the attendees of yesterday’s SOSNA meeting. “This is a great opportunity,” Baker continued. “It offers the potential of being a transformational project. It not only builds on what you have, but offers an opportunity to lead a new direction.”After the meeting’s initial introductions, attendees were encouraged to describe how the site could be best used to serve the neighborhood. Among the ideas that were discussed included: Defined as “a meeting before the meeting before the meeting” by John Adler, co-chair of SOSNA’s zoning committee, yesterday’s meeting will be followed by two others in the coming months. The project team intends to present a proposal in September, followed by an additional zoning review with SOSNA and introduction of the newly proposed ordinance."
Blatstein officially buys South Broad and Washington corner for big development,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/31/16059926/bart-blatstein-purchases-1001-s-broad-development,article,"Last week, Bart Blatstein officially became the new owner of the northeast corner of South Broad Street and Washington Avenue, nearly giving him the go ahead to proceed with a big mixed-use development at 1001 S. Broad Street. Philadelphia Business Journal first reported that the developer settled a lawsuit with the owner, NH Philadelphia Properties, which had sued Blatstein in 2016 over his legal claim to the property. Although Blatstein did not own the northeast corner at the time, he had started the design, development, and zoning processes with the city to build a 195,000-square-foot mixed-use project on the site. A settlement was reached between the two parties, allowing Blatstein to close on the sale for an estimated $20 million. Two neighbors have filed an appeal regarding the developer’s zoning win, but Blatstein’s lawyer says he’s “confident we’ll overcome that.” Last year, prior to the lawsuit, the plans called for 944 apartments in a 32-story tower, plus a retail “village” located above a parking garage. According to the report, the plan now is to build 1,000 apartments and 160,000-square-feet of retail. There’s no construction timeline on the project as of yet. When it does break ground, it will be neighbors to another mixed-use, mid-rise development called Lincoln Square across the street. Lincoln Square has been on the rise since early 2017. "
Comcast Technology Center nearly 150 feet away from topping off,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/28/16055110/comcast-technology-center-topping-off,article,"With less than 200 feet to go, the 60-story Comcast Technology Center is so close to reaching the major construction milestone of topping off. “There are over 150 feet of structure remaining to be put into place,” John Gattuso, senior vice president and regional director for Liberty Property Trust, confirmed to Curbed Philly in an e-mail. “As work continues over the coming months, we will pinpoint a date for topping off.""Billy Penn first reported the news, saying that the $1.2 billion tower is three floors away from topping off. It comes just a couple of weeks after Comcast and Liberty Property Trust revealed new renderings and details about the Four Seasons Hotel, which will set up shop on the upper levels of the tower and is slated to be the tallest hotel in the country. At 1,121 feet, the Foster+Partners-designed tower will become the tallest building in Philadelphia, the state of Pennsylvania, and outside of New York and Chicago. It broke ground in 2014 and has been on the rise ever since. Barring a minor delay regarding a union strike earlier this summer, construction has moved along swiftly, although the original timeline called for a fall 2017 completion.

Eastern Tower Community Center development to begin with funds secured,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/28/16055050/chinatown-eastern-tower-community-center-financing-groundbreaking,article,"This should be the year that Chinatown finally sees the Eastern Tower Community Center take shape at 10th and Vine.Governor Tom Wolf announced this week that with total financing secured for the $76 million project, development will begin on the 20-story tower. The project calls for 45,000 square feet of recreational space and retail on the first through fifth floors and 150 residential units on the upper levels. The tower has been in the works since 2011. The news was first reported by the Philadelphia Business Journal and comes after years of waiting for work to begin at the site as the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC) tried to secure financing for the project. In October 2016, after it received a $1.3 million state grant, the plan was to break ground by the end of that year and finish construction by late 2017. By February 2017, the site remained a parking lot. Now, with help from a $9 million New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) financing transaction, total financing has been secured. General contractor Hunter Roberts has been given the green light to begin construction, and Curbed Philly is told that an official groundbreaking will be scheduled for September. The project’s goal is to bring a much-needed community center to the neighborhood that’s essentially been chopped up by the Vine Street Expressway and provide affordable housing for the Chinatown community. Said Wolf in a statement, “This project is exciting not only for its commercial and recreational offerings for families in that area, but it has the potential to help reconnect the Chinatown community that is split by the Vine Street Expressway.”"
New homes rising at site of Point Breeze homes destroyed in fire,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/27/16050044/point-breeze-fire-wharton-place-homes-for-sale,article,"A developer has wasted no time getting back to work after a fire destroyed four homes and damaged several others in a new Point Breeze development in May. Developer Ori Feibush told Billy Penn that his team is building 11 new homes at 20th and Wharton next to the site of where the fire occurred. The fire, which was ruled as arson, is still being investigated. Feibush, who has built dozens of properties in the rapidly developing Point Breeze neighborhood, is still offering $102,500 in reward money for anyone to come forward with information. The developer also pointed out that the fire caused actually caused a hike in housing prices in the neighborhood, likely the opposite of what the potential arsonist had in mind:“It’s had a very immediate impact on housing prices in the neighborhood, making them more expensive. Not less,” Feibush said. “The lack of supply this fire created ensured these homes are selling for $50 or $60K more since then.”The prices of homes at 20th and Wharton start at $625,000. Currently, one of the homes on the market is asking $635,000. It’s currently under construction and expected to deliver by the end of the year. "
Video: Watch Phillys skyline grow from 1900 to today,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/27/16049712/philadelphia-skyscraper-timeline-video,article,"With all this recent talk about Philly’s changing skyline—and its potential to keep on growing—a new video really puts it all into perspective. Using 3D images and a birds eye view of Philly’s Center City, commercial real estate website Commercial Cafe created a 2:34-minute video documenting the evolution of Philly’s skyline from 1900 to today, starting with its very first skyscraper, the North American Building at 121 S. Broad Street. It’s a really telling visual of Philly’s development history. What’s even more crazy to think about is that Philly’s skyline really started with Independence Hall, built in 1753. From there, it’s all been uphill. Fast forward next year, when the 60-story Comcast Technology Center debuts as the tallest building in Philadelphia and outside of New York and Chicago. Watch the video below, then take a look at our map to see what will be Philly’s 13 tallest buildings by 2020. "
New report reveals development potential of Phillys vacant industrial land,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/27/16036168/philadelphia-industrial-land-development-map,article,"Like most other major U.S. cities, Philadelphia’s need for more housing at all price points is growing day by day. A recent report found that the metro needs to add some 38,000 apartments by 2030 to meet its rising demand. Meanwhile, housing inventory of single-family homes in Philly is at an all-time low, causing housing prices to skyrocket and bidding wars to escalate. Meanwhile, Philly still has plenty of room to grow. But where? Look to the city’s large swaths of industrial land. That’s according to FixList Co., a Philly-based online company that provides real estate data for investment opportunities throughout the city. It recently came out with a report highlighting Philly’s industrial land (zoned industrial I-1, I-2, or I-3 classification)  how it’s currently being used, and its potential for redevelopment. FixList Co. found that 28 percent of land has been assigned a single-family category code by the Office of Property Assessment (OPA). A majority of the industrial land parcels can be found in the Northeast (think Port Richmond, Frankford, Kensington, etc). The area around Grays Ferry also made the top 10 the list. These are also the same zip codes where the most sales of industrial land parcels has occurred between 2008 and 2016. Some of this land has already been used to build residential, retail, and commercial developments. But much of it still remains vacant.This map shows zip codes with the highest parcel count of industrially zoned properties.FixList Co. argues that with the current state of Philadelphia’s housing market, now’s the time to invest in Philly’s vacant industrial land. Of all of the industrial land in West Kensington (19133), for example, 42 percent of it remains inactive or vacant. “Already, property assessment data suggests that more than half of the land with an industrial I-1, I-2, or I-3 base zoning classification is being used for residential purposes or is currently vacant, further suggesting a return to the manufacturing heydey of the mid-20th century is unlikely.”Here are the top five zip codes with the most sales between 2008 and 2016, and percentage of land that remains vacant. FixList Co.’s full breakdown can be found here. Editor’s note: A previous version of this article stated that the chart included the number of industrial parcels by zip code. It is the number of industrial parcels sold between 2008 and 2016, as well as the percentage of industrial land that remains vacant. "
An updated timeline of 10 exciting Schuylkill River Trail projects,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/1/21/10844788/schuylkill-river-trail-projects-timeline,article,"Editor's Note: This article was originally published in January 2016 and has since been updated with the most recent information. In January 2016, the Schuylkill River Development Corporation (SRDC) released its strategic plan for 2016-2020, and if there's one thing we pulled out of the 41-page document it's that the Schuylkill River trail is going to look very different in 10 years. The plan laid out nearly a dozen projects that are in the works along the river, from the $6.6 million Bartram's Mile, which has since opened, to the $4 billion 30th Street Station Master Plan in 2026.But a lot has changed since 2016. That $4 billion estimate for the 30th Street Station Master Plan is now up to $6.5 billion, for example.Fortunately, some of projects that are currently under construction have since received state funding, helping push them to the finish line. And there have even been some updates since May 2017, when we last updated this timeline: The SRDC now has more information to share on long-awaited projects like the South to Christian connection and the Schuylkill Crossing at Grays Ferry.Find out more about all of these projects and their projected completion dates below.

Demo work begins for Penns Landing capping project,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/25/16025406/penns-landing-capping-project-demolition-timeline,article,"Construction isn’t expected to begin on the capping of I-95 and Penn’s Landing for another three years, but demolition work is expected to begin this week on a series of rarely-used highway ramps. The Delaware River Waterfront Corporation (DRWC) told the Inquirer’s Inga Saffron that it will begin demolishing a series of scissor ramps between Market and Chestnut Streets on Wednesday in preparation of the capping project. Once the demo is complete in four months, it will be turned into its own park. Saffron wrote: The scissor ramps are just north of where the cap will eventually be built. Although work on the cover park is not expected to start before 2021, Forkin said his agency decided to remove the ramps now because they receive so little use — about 1,200 car trips a day. The 2.6-acre area occupied by the ramps is designated for mixed-use housing in the Central Delaware master plan, and the waterfront agency hopes to start marketing the site to developers once demolition is complete.Residents of the Pier 3 condos will be affected by the demolition since they use the ramps to drive in and out of their condo building. The demolition is the first physical sign of work at the future site of the Penn’s Landing capping and civic spaces project. The plan is to cap over the site with an 11-acre park, and bring 1,500 new housing units, 500 hotel rooms, and more than 100,000-square-feet of retail, restaurants, and entertainment to the site. In early June, DWRC announced that the total funding for the $225 million project had been secured. The design process, including permits and construction documents, is expected to wrap up by the end of 2019, while construction is expected to finish by 2021. "
FMC Tower nearly 100 percent leased with Brandywine on board,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/24/16019534/fmc-tower-brandywine-realty-trust-lease-university-city,article,"Brandywine Realty Trust, the developer responsible for a large chunk of University City’s building boom, is moving out of its headquarters in the ‘burbs and into the recently completed FMC Tower. The move from Radnor to University City is part of the developer’s continuing effort to invest in West Philly, Brandywine said in a statement. With Brandywine Realty signing on, FMC Tower is now 96 percent leased, a spokesperson confirmed to Curbed Philly. Just 38,518 square feet remains up for grabs. Already, the 49-story FMC Tower is home to a long list of tenants, such as FMC Corporation and the University of Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, AKA University City has opened its 268 luxury hotel units on the top floors of the tower. Brandywine Realty Trust is also embarking on another major multi-billion project nearby with Drexel University, which means the move is coming at an opportune time for the developer. Brandywine and Drexel are behind the multi-billion dollar Schuylkill Yards project, which recently received City Council approval and is expected to break ground this year. As part of its role in the project, Brandywine recently committed $5 million to a Neighborhood Engagement Initiative. The developer’s move is also on trend with suburban-based offices moving into Philadelphia. A recent JLL report on Philadelphia’s skyline pointed this out, stating “Suburban tenants are dipping their toes in the city, CBD companies are growing, and established firms are looking to differentiate in new or renovated spaces.”"
"Phillys skyline has room to grow compared to rest of U.S., report finds",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/24/15999992/philadelphia-skyline-construction-stats-comparison,article,"Ever since One Liberty Place surpassed the height of Billy Penn atop City Hall, Philadelphia’s skyline has been on the rise. Next year, it will be even taller with the opening of the Comcast Technology Center, the tallest tower in the city and state of Pennsylvania.But while Philly has experienced a recent explosion of trophy towers and class A buildings, its skyline still has plenty of catching up to do with the rest of the U.S. From the glass half full perspective, Philly still has room to grow. That’s according to a new Skyline report released by the commercial real estate firm JLL, which took a deep dive into various U.S. cities’ skylines and the buildings that make them up. In the case of Philadelphia, this ranges from The old Post Office building at 2970 Market to the Comcast Technology Center. “Things are really good by Philadelphia standards, but if you take a moment and look outside of region itself, we do have a long way to go,” said Lauren Gilchrist, vice president and director of research at JLL Philadelphia. “There is opportunity here that we’ll continue to see as our economy and population expand.” Here are some of the key findings from the report: JLL’s Skyline Analysis8.9 percent total vacancy$31.18 direct average asking rent/s.f.2,179,000 s.f. under construction-2.6 percent 2016 net absorption 5.4 percent 2016 asking rent growth$1.2B 2016 and Q1 2017 sales volumeThe report found that there is about 2.1 million square feet of new construction underway in Philly that’s set to change its skyline. “We only have about 7 percent of the entire country’s skyline located in our market, which is a small percentage overall,” noted Gilchrist. New York, meanwhile, makes up 34 percent of the country’s new 35 million square feet of skyline construction. On average, the country’s office vacancy rates this year are holding at about 12.9 percent. Philly’s skyline offices, meanwhile, are about 8.9 percent vacant, showing that it’s a considerably tighter market here than the country as a whole. That’s a result of a few things, including the fact that Philly hasn’t seen as much speculative construction as other markets have, says Gilchrist. In addition, Philly seems to have a high pre-leasing rate than in other U.S. cities. Comcast Technology Center, which acconts for 1,334,000 million square feet of the city’s skyline, of course, is a bit of a different beast, since it’s already 100 percent leased by its namesake company while still under construction. The average asking rent per square foot in Philadelphia is $31.18. While that is a 5.4 percent increase from 2016, it’s extremely low compared to other major U.S. cities. (In fact, a separate JLL report took note of Market East being the most affordable retail corridor in the nation.) Take San Francisco, for example, where average rent is more than double Philly’s at $76.11 per square feet. That’s even cheaper than New York’s $87.90 and Washington’s $83.09. With low vacancy rates and 6 million square feet of office space expected to rollover in the next three years, landlords will likely be pretty busy for 2017 and 2018, according to the report. “Six million square feet of existing tenants currently occupying space in the market have the option to renew in place or relocate,” said Gilchrist, “so that means a lot of transaction and activity coming down the pike.”Gilchrist noted, however, that there has been a slowdown in leasing rates in the first and second quarters of 2017. “We are starting to see some evidence of downsizing simply because of the expiration of 10-year leases that were signed prior to the previous recession, when the market was going gangbusters nationally from an economic perspective.” One of the sure-fire ways to tell that a city’s market is truly “hot” is by the amount of top buyers or foreign buyers investing in local property. Philly hasn’t quite made that leap yet, said Gilchrist. “Even though locally it feels like the market is going gangbusters and is on fire, looking at top buyers around the country and where they’ve bought, we really only have one of them, which is Shorenstein,” Gilchrist noted. “Philadelphia has historically struggled to attract institutional capital to this market.” "
Old Citys arts community finds its way amid a sea of change,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/24/16005392/old-city-philadelphia-arts-community-snyderman-works-gallery,article,"When Ruth and Rick Snyderman close their Snyderman-Works Gallery at the end of July, they’ll be leaving behind a very different Old City than the one they knew when they first moved to 303 Cherry Street in the early 1990s. Except for a smattering of artists who had begun squatting in or renting big spaces in the 1970s at low rates (some as cheap as 40 cents per square foot), the neighborhood was mostly a derelict industrial area and a wholesale kitchen district. According to Rick, “You could roll a bowling ball down 3rd Street without hitting anything.” Unfazed, the Snyderman’s proceeded to turn the ground floor and basement of their recently purchased building into the new home for their American crafts-focused gallery. They also turned the upper floor a lofted apartment, their home.Together with the small band of other arts businesses that had begun flocking to the large spaces and more affordable price tags of Old City addresses, the Snyderman’s promoted their new neighborhood and initiated programs such as First Fridays, transforming a hodgepodge mix of visual artists, performers, and designers into a veritable arts and design district.Fast forward 25 years, and Old City—Philadelphia’s city center for its earliest two centuries—is a different place. “We have the most art and design spaces per capita of anywhere else in the city,” says Job Itzkowitz, executive director of Old City District. And it has plenty more residents than the 80 listed in the 1970 U.S. Census. The district’s current population of 3,500 (going on 5,000, Itzkowitz adds) expects more than the subpar living conditions willingly accepted by the artists who first moved to Old City. To cater to these demands, the area is experiencing a wave of new development. The recently completed Bridge at 205 Race Street, an 18-story mixed use building with 146 apartments, is expected to begin occupancy this summer. Meanwhile, construction has begun on The National at 130 N. 2nd Street, which will add 192 residential units next door to Elfreth’s Alley.But what will this mean for the established artists, who once moved to Old City looking for big spaces on the cheap?For some longstanding residents, such as The Clay Studio, it will mean moving to more affordable quarters. The ceramic arts-focused nonprofit was born in Old City back in 1974, founded by artist Ken Vavrek and four of his students from Moore College of Art & Design. They initially met on the third floor of Vavrek’s rowhome near Cherry and Orianna Streets, but quickly outgrew the space and moved four times before ending up with a 30-year rental lease with generous terms at 139 N. 2nd Street.  Their landlord, Harry Caplan, owned many nearby properties (including The National) and was dubbed “the mayor of 2nd Street,” says Christopher Taylor, president of The Clay Studio. “I think [Caplan’s] genius was, ‘Look, if I can get a group in here to improve this clunky property and give them a low enough rate to invest their cash into the building and bring human beings around, then all the property values will go up and all the activity will rise’.” The Clay Studio may have done too good of a job. Their lease expires in January 2019, and with the increased property values in the area, they can’t afford to stay. The 2016 average rent per square foot in Old City was listed at $24.07, among the priciest in the city.Artists and galleries go where property is affordable, moving to Northern Liberties, Fishtown, and Kensington (including The Clay Studio, which will be building a new home for itself at 1425 N. American Street). And some of the older galleries that came to Old City early on—such as Snyderman-Works Gallery and Rosenfeld Gallery—are closing altogether as their owners retire.In order to maintain the artistic focus of the neighborhood, Itzkowitz has spoken with commercial brokers to try to recruit large, New York-based galleries to open showrooms in Old City. But overall, the creative community still wants to be in Old City, if it can afford it. Arch Enemy Arts, a contemporary art gallery, opened in Old City in 2012 and its co-founder and director, Patrick Shillenn, is also active as a board member of Old City District.And 303 Cherry Street, which has been home to Snyderman-Works Gallery for the past 25 years, will soon house the local interior design firm Kelly Mericle Design. “After exploring different neighborhoods in Philly, we chose Old City for a number of reasons,” Mericle says. “We love that Old City has a strong sense of community, and it’s inspiring to be surrounded by like-minded individuals who have a passion for design and the arts.”Ruth and Rick Snyderman are staying in the neighborhood, too. “In moving out of our building, we didn’t want to look anywhere else but Old City, because it’s really like a little village,” Ruth says. “Many times, when you walk out and just want to go to the mailbox on the corner, it takes a half an hour because you see so many people to talk to, that you enjoy.”"
33 affordable housing homes approved for Point Breeze,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/20/16000494/mamie-nichols-townhouses-point-breeze-affordable-housing,article,"With the city’s Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) approval, two plots of land in rapidly developing Point Breeze will be the future site of 33 affordable apartments and townhomes.Yesterday, the ZBA voted 3-0 to approve plans to build the Mamie Nichols Townhouses on two plots of vacant land in Point Breeze, the Women’s Community Revitalization Project (WCRP) announced. The 33 townhomes, a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments and townhomes, will be available for rent for low-income families. Eleven of the homes will be reserved for veterans. The news comes at a time when Philly is in the middle of a affordable housing shortage. Between 2000 and 2014, the city lost 20 percent of its low-cost housing stock. And recent affordable housing lotteries have experienced a deluge of applicants: The Orinoka Civic House in Kensington received 600 applications for 51 affordable rentals earlier this year. Project HOME received some 1,000 applications for 88 units for its new affordable housing units on North Broad. Meanwhile, Point Breeze’s real estate market is considered one of the hottest in the city. Its 19146 zip code experienced the most home sales in the month of May this year out of any other neighborhood in Philly. The Mamie Nichols Townhouses, named after the late founder and executive director of the Point Breeze Federation, will take shape at 1308-1344 South Capitol Street and 1400-1428 South Taylor Street. The lots of land are located 0.4 miles from each other. The WCRP and project partner Citizens Acting Together Can Help (CATCH) are leading the efforts. There is no set construction timeline yet. "
Bidding war emerges for North Philly land intended for LGBTQ affordable housing,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/19/15997960/project-home-lgbtq-housing-kensington-bankruptcy-auction,article,"Project HOME, a non-profit organization dedicated to affordable housing efforts, had big plans to build a $13 million LGBTQ affordable housing complex on a series of parcels in North Philly, the first project of its kind in the city. But now, the charity will have to make a big bid on the land at 1315 N. 8th Street at a bankruptcy auction in August, after higher bids came to the table last month, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer report.  The land is owned by the now-bankrupt North Philadelphia Health System, which began marketing its remaining properties here earlier this year. The land includes three buildings, including a psychiatric hospital and two health clinics.Project HOME intended to purchase some of the parcels from NPHS and build affordable housing for 30 LGBTQ young adults. It would be the organization’s latest project after 2415 North Broad Street, which had about 1,000 applicants for just 88 spots. In June, NPHS was given a month to wait for potential higher bids. One of the bids that came through was a $10 million offer from a medical chain based in Tennessee. But other offers also came from investors “that are strictly interested in the real estate at Eighth Street and West Girard Avenue,” according to the Inquirer.Now, Project HOME and other investors will have to bid on the parcels at a bankruptcy auction scheduled for August 11. The organization has already raised $13.5 million for the project from state grants, the city, and private money. But those funds will be lost by August if Project HOME fails to win the bid. "
Study: Philly must add 38K apartments by 2030 to meet rising demand,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/18/15982162/philadelphia-rent-real-estate-apartment-construction-affordable-housing,article,"In order to meet its growing demand, Philly will need to add 38,407 new apartments by 2030. Problem is, Philadelphia is one of the toughest cities to add necessary households for renters. The Philadelphia metro ranks sixth out of 50 metros in terms of hardest cities to add new apartments, according to a new report by the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Association (NAA). Honolulu took the number one spot in the ranking. In general, the U.S. must add 4.6 million new apartments by 2030 to meet its rising demand.But the Philly metro has a number of barriers that could prevent enough apartment growth, according to the report. It ranked 5th out of 50 as one of the more restrictive metro areas, with No. 1 being the most restrictive. The following areas played into Philly’s high ranking: [L]engthy and sometimes multiple approval processes even when proper zoning is in place; use of control density with some type of minimum lot size restraint; use of affordable housing requirements and/or open space and infrastructure cost requirements in some areas; long-term lot development cost increases in excess of general inflation; and lengthy review times. Despite all that, Philadelphia itself has seen a boom in apartment building renovations and construction in recent years, although much of it has occurred in the Greater Center City neighborhoods. In Center City alone, about 30 residential projects are currently under construction or have been proposed. Just a handful of those 30 are condominium developments. But the NMHC/NAA report suggests that Philly needs even more apartments than it’s already shelling out. More importantly, they need to be at all price points—not just those at the high end of the market, said Miles Orth, president of the Pennsylvania Apartment Association and Pennsylvania Apartment Association East.Research conducted by Hoyt Advisory Services for the report found that due to a projected rise in apartment household growth, growth in renters, and population growth, Philly is expected to need about 38,000 new apartments by 2030. But at the current average annual construction rate in Philly, it’s projected to build only 32,930 apartments by that point. Apartments were defined as a rental in a building that has five or more units.More Philly metro data from the study can be found here."
First Look: Four Seasons Hotel at Comcast Technology Center renderings revealed,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/17/15983170/four-seasons-hotel-comcast-tower-philadelphia-renderings,article,"The grand opening is still about a year away, but already the Four Seasons Hotel at the Comcast Technology Center is prepping for its big debut in 2018. First things first: Bringing on Philly native Ben Shank as general manager of the 217-room hotel, which will set up shop on the top 12 floors of the 60-story building, designed by Foster+Partners. Shank, who started out as a busboy at the now-shuttered Fountain Restaurant in Philly, said his goal is to create an atmosphere that will make the new hotel “a reason to visit the city in and of itself.”The Comcast Technology Center in general will undoubtedly be a must-visit place in Philly when it opens next year. Standing tall at 1,121 feet, it will be the tallest building in Philly and the state Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the Four Seasons Hotel will be the “most highly situated hotel above street-level in North America,” according to John Gattuso, senior vice president and regional director for Liberty Property Trust, which is a partner on the hotel with Comcast.Here are more details and renderings of what to expect at the Four Seasons Hotel. The Four Seasons will be home to 218 high-end hotel rooms—including 38 suites. The entire hotel clocks in at 263,000 square feet. Nightly rates have not yet been revealed.The spa, fitness center, and indoor lap pool will be located on the 57th floor, according to the Inquirer. Based on this rendering, a dip in the pool will make for one of the most interesting swimming experiences in the city. An express elevator will bring guests straight to the hotel, located on the 48th through 60th floors of the 60-story tower. The express service will bring people directly to floor 57 and up, where the hotel amenities will be located. A restaurant and lounge will take up the top floor of the tower. In addition to the hotel, Four Seasons will also manage the three condo units located on the 45th floor of the tower. These units were purchased by Comcast CEO Brian Roberts as private residences for $14.3 million. The rest of the tower, of course, will be home to Comcast employees. There will also be more restaurants, retail, and public spaces open to the public. "
RFQ issued for midcentury modern health center on Broad Street,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/17/15981592/health-center-no-1-philadelphia-for-sale-rfq,article,"Health Center No. 1, a midcentury modern building that dates back to 1959 is up for grabs. The Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) has issued an RFQ for the 55,880-square-foot building at the corner of Broad and Lombard streets, asking developers to pitch their plans for a “dynamic and sustainable mixed-use development” on the site, Naked Philly first reported. The RFP, which was issued on Friday, July 17, states that plans are already underway for Health Center No. 1 to be relocated to another location by mid-2018. That leaves this property at 500-10 S. Broad Street marked for development potential along the Avenue of the Arts, which “has become a hotbed of investment for the city of Philadelphia,” the RFP notes. The health center is located just a stone’s throw away from already-established residential developments as well as future projects like the 45-story SLS International Hotel & Residences at Broad and Spruce streets.The health center itself was designed by Montgomery & Bishop in 1959 as one of 10 neighborhood health centers built in the city after World War II. The curvy building has long been a standout on the corner of Broad and Lombard, thanks to its teal-tiled facade—the bright colors were meant to lift the spirits of patients.The RFP says it’s looking for a proposal that brings active uses to the ground floor level (think retail and restaurants), while the upper stories could be residential, hotel, or more commercial space. It continues, “The City and PIDC are open to proposals that reuse the existing building, redevelop the site or some combination of the two. The City is willing to consider proposals that incorporate or relocate the existing City uses.”Currently, the site is zoned CMX-4 for Center City Commercial Mixed-Use. Proposals are due by September 22, 2017. The PIDC will then short-list interested developers, who will then submit their proposals for the site. A finalist will then be chosen and will enter into an Agreement of Sale with Philadelphia Authority For Industrial Development (PAID)."
Station Plaza at 30th Street Station: What to expect at the future civic space,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/13/15962148/30th-street-station-district-plan-station-plaza-renderings,article,"At an open house held at 30th Street Station Tuesday afternoon, a design proposal for Station Plaza, the grand civic space planned as part of the 30th Street Station District Plan, was revealed. The proposal, designed by FXFOWLE, !melk, and ARUP, calls for increased pedestrian pathways, circular paving patterns, skylights on the sidewalk, and elevated tree planters surrounding 30th Street Station. The main goal of this reconfiguration, Amtrak says, is to provide the grand train station with the grand public space. As one poster put it at the open house, “30th Street Station was never properly ‘grounded’ into Philadelphia’s urban fabric. A magnificent station deserves a spectacular plaza.” If you missed the open house, the proposals and online survey are now available on the 30th Street Station District’s website for public perusal. The 30th Street Station District timeline says that early Station Plaza upgrades should begin around 2020 and be complete around 2029. Below, we’ve highlighted some of the major features that are part of the proposed Station Plaza. One of the proposed features that immediately pops out on the renderings are the circular patterns that dot the public plaza. Designer Jerry van Eyck, principal of !melk, says the polka dots are intentional, as they follow the path of the Amtrak train tracks below. These circular patterns will be accompanied by some water fountain features that double as skylights, as well as built-in benches that will also function as tree planters. Van Eyck says, “These planters are quite smart because they provide seating but also drive the pedestrian flow.” The addition of an entrance at the station’s West Portico is another proposed way to increase pedestrian access to and from the building. The entrance would include a stairwell down to the new underground SEPTA-Amtrak connection and retail concourse (more on that below). Joe Pikiewicz of FXFOWLE says the idea isn’t even a novel one: The original 1934 plans for 30th Street Station included an entrance at the West Portico. “One of our main charges was to solve the particular problems with taxis, cars, and drop-offs,” said Pikiewicz. Currently, there are multiple drop-off points around the station that cause conflicts between pedestrians and drivers. To fix this, the taxi queue will be below-grade and out of site, off to the northwest corner of the station. Drop-offs, meanwhile, will also be redirected to the north side, where the North Concourse will eventually be re-opened. Jerry van Eycke describes the site plan, which wraps around the entire building, as two C-shaped areas: The Market Street side of the station will be dedicated toward the civic space, while the opposite C on the Arch Street side is considered the transportation zone.“The end goal is really trying to make this less of a place for cars to stop and drop off passengers and allow us to have more pedestrian space,” Pikiewicz said.The design proposal includes an underground passage with retail that will connect the SEPTA station and Amtrak. Passengers would also be able to access this retail concourse via a stairway from the new West Portico Concourse.This wasn’t exactly part of the Station Plaza proposal, but it was included in the site plan anyway. One of the biggest gripes about the current station is that there is no underground connection between the SEPTA station and 30th Street Station—passengers have to leave their respective station and a four-way intersection to make the switch.

49 studio apartments proposed for South Kensington lot,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/13/15960460/south-kensington-micro-apartments-live-work,article,"Stop us if you’ve heard this one before: A local developer wants to build a 49-unit residential project on a large lot in Kensington. But instead of $450,000 townhomes, the plan calls for 49 studio apartments, renting for $750 a month. That’s the plan, at least, for developer Allan Nadav, who in 2016 bought a vacant warehouse at 1613-27 Germantown Avenue for $600,000 and promptly tore it down. He now wants to build a four-story apartment complex on the 10,000-square-foot lot, complete with the small-sized apartments, commercial space, coworking offices, and three parking spaces. His pitch is to build a purpose-built community for the next generation of urban renters.“I want to cater to people who are post-college, done living with roommates, and want to grow up and have their own place,” said Nadav in an interview with Curbed Philly. “But they may not be able to afford the $1,200 to $1,300 needed to live in the new luxury apartment buildings going up everywhere else in the city.”This would be the first project of its kind for Nadav, who has rehabbed a few smaller properties nearby and turned them into rentals and commercial space. How exactly does the private developer plan to keep monthly rents below market rate? “By using an extremely simplified structure,” Nadav says. “Each unit is built like a cookie cutter project to bring down construction costs, but are designed to be fully customizable.”The studios will all have the same floor plan and clock in at 440 square feet—that’s a bit larger than the average micro unit, which is typically about 350 square feet. The apartments will also have in-unit laundry and five-by-five-foot private balconies that look out to the interior courtyard. In addition, seven of the 49 units will be live-work spaces on the first floor, which will add the commercial and retail component to the mixed-use development. These units, which will include a studio and a commercial space for the respective tenant, will rent for about $1,200 a month. The micro-unit movement is one that hasn’t quite caught on in Philly yet, save for the Avenir apartments in Center City. But it is an idea that’s been floating around again in recent months. In Strawberry Mansion, for example, there’s a proposal to build 12 micro-apartments and sell them to millennials for about $100,000. “The people that are moving into the rental units in urban neighborhoods have spent their whole life living in their room, whether it’s at home or in dorm rooms,” Nadav argues. “It’s not a lifestyle change to move into a smaller place with a large bedroom-living space and nice-sized kitchen off to the side. It’s not a stretch of the imagination to see if the younger generation would be willing to move into such a space.”Nadav’s project can be built by-right, but it will require a zoning variance for the proposed three parking spaces, which will be used for car-share services. Current zoning requires 15 parking spaces and another two ADA spaces. The project will be presented at an information-only session to South Kensington Neighborhood Association on July 26, according to Nadav. If all goes to plan, the developer hopes to break ground on the project by the end of the year or early January 2018. "
3737 Chestnut tower in University City sells for $118M,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/12/15960242/3737-chestnut-sold-university-city-philadelphia,article,"3737 Chestnut, a 26-story apartment tower in University City, has been sold for $118 million.Radnor Property Group just announced the sale of its relatively new-ish property to Korman Residential Properties and The Carlyle Group for the pricey sum, amounting to $544 per square foot. Currently, all 276 luxury units are leased. The big sale comes as Radnor Property Group focuses its attention on its two other residential projects in Philly. Its 16-story tower Vue32, also in University City, is also finishing up construction and already leasing, and work is set to begin on a series of townhomes on the same site. In addition, Radnor also just broke ground on the Hamilton, a multi-phase residential project in Logan Square. For 3737 Chestnut, Radnor Property Group partnered with Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral to help preserve the church in addition to building the 26-story tower. In total, the project cost about $92.5 million. "
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts finds its place on North Broad,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/12/15953098/pafa-renovations-philadelphia,article,"The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) is the first and oldest fine arts school and museum in the country. Yet despite its age, the 212-year-old institution on North Broad is looking better than ever—and it’s makeover is really only just getting started. PAFA is $16 million through its $25 million capital campaign, PAFA First, which launched in September 2016 as a way to preserve its historic buildings and art collections and enhance the institution, bringing it up to speed with the ongoing transformation happening up and down the North Broad corridor. “For the past 50 years we’ve been here, watching what’s been happening around us,” said PAFA’s president and CEO David Brigham on a recent visit. “We realized that we wanted to not only contribute to the change on North Broad, but also benefit from it.”Next year, some of PAFA’s blockbuster enhancements of the main building will debut: A 275-seat auditorium, a new gallery space featuring students’ work, and temperature-controlled storage facility to house the museum’s growing art collection. And that’s just the plan for the building’s basement, led by DLR Group, the same design firm that led the renovations of the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C. But in reality, PAFA’s transformation has been slowly but surely taking place in bits and pieces for the past two decades. First, there was the school’s move from Cherry Street to its current location in an automobile showroom next to the National Historic Landmark building. That move was partially paid by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which went on to build the Pennsylvania Convention Center across the street. That move came with a renovation of the 11-story, 300,000-square-foot Hamilton building, turning the warehouse into sculpture, printing, and painting studios with sweeping views of Center City. The Lenfest Plaza came soon after in 1999, connecting the school and the museum together via a paved public space.But a big chunk of the capital campaign funds have already gone toward restoring and preserving the Historic Landmark building, designed by Frank Furness and George Hewitt in 1876. The iconic jewelry box building that features Furness’s signature ornate architectural details, including gold and silver leaf detailing both inside and out, was in need of great repair. Work on the roof included the replacement of skylights, stone restoration, and replacement of copper gutters. The restoration of the original brick chimney and a new boiler system amounted to $2 million in repairs alone. Work is still ongoing at the landmark building. Next up, the building will be made ADA compliant, with a handicap accessible entrance and restroom.But perhaps the least expensive effort of the $25 million campaign will be PAFA’s most important yet: A $4.1 million cosmetic change to the facade of the Hamilton Building, including an LED lighting program, new signage, and the opening up the first two floors of the building. Already this year, the transparent Broad Street Studio debuted on the corner of North Broad and Lenfest Plaza, where students and artists paint and sculpt in a glass-enclosed box. Meanwhile, the first two floors of the Hamilton building will be opened up and lit up by an LED lighting system similar to that found at the Masonic Temple and City Hall up the street. “It will help wake up the building,” says Brigham. “It can be hard to notice a building in the urban context.”But most of all, Brigham says, the hope is that the slight cosmetic upgrades will enhance PAFA’s presence along North Broad. “We knew our neighborhood was changing,” he says, “and we knew we wanted to be a part of it.”"
Watch Penn Medicine Pavilion complete largest concrete pour in Phillys history,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/12/15953988/penn-medicine-pavilion-concrete-pour-video,article,"After 14 hours, 654 trucks, and more than 6,500 cubic yards of concrete, the foundation has been set for the $1.5 billion Foster+Partners-designed Pavilion on Penn Medicine’s Campus. The concrete pour, which took place on Saturday, July 8, was the largest concrete pour in Philly’s history. Penn Medicine captured the 14-hour pour and condensed it into this mesmerizing one-minute video, PhillyVoice first reported. The pour included 6,540 cubic yards of concrete—enough to fill a Goodyear blimp—onto the site of the former Penn Medicine tower. That amount surpassed the 5,850 cubic yards of concrete poured at the W/Element Hotels site in Center City. The Penn Medicine tower was demolished in 2016, but Penn Medicine didn’t officially break ground on the Pavilion until May of this year. Before the concrete pour, 965 tons of reinforcement steel were installed, also serving as the 1.25 million-square-foot building’s foundation. The Pavilion is a 17-story project that will include 500 patient rooms and four floors of operating rooms. Foster+Partners’ renderings for the project were first revealed in November 2016. Construction is set to finish up in 2021. "
"As University City booms, an urban meadow grows at uCity Square",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/11/15938472/ucity-square-urban-meadow-park-philadelphia,article,"The site of the now-demolished University City High School is currently fenced-in, filled with giant piles of dirt, wood chips, and gravel. A dozen or so dumpster containers and trailers sit off to one side, facing the rising 14-story tower at 3675 Market. For the most part, the large swath of land is a pretty bleak, and quite frankly, ugly, construction site. In any other situation, this future site of uCity’s Square’s public space would stay that way for the remainder of the construction’s timeframe. But this isn’t a normal project, says Nate Hommel, University City District’s (UCD) director of planning and design. If all goes to plan, in a year’s time this area will be covered in a beautiful, tree-laden meadow with a walking path.About a year ago, developer Wexford Technology approached UCD with an idea: “Let’s try something to get people thinking a little differently about this place,” Hommel recalls the developer saying. “Let’s bring the public in early to get them acclimated to the site and help humanize this space, because it’s so massive.”A post shared by uCity Square (@ucitysquare) on Feb 11, 2016 at 10:12am PSTThe site itself is set to become part of uCity Square’s campus, which will ultimately span 11 city blocks and consist of a 6.5 million-square-foot mixed-use development. Local landscape architecture firm OLIN already has a design set for the public space, which will be called uCity Square and about the same size of the Comcast Tower’s plaza. But the finish line of the project as a whole is multiple years away. That long timeline is what concerned Wexford and UCD. How, over the next few years, could the project continue to engage the neighborhood in a better way than simply throwing up a fence around a massive, vacant lot? “The fear is that you create this complex of fancy, shiny buildings with a public space in the center—but nobody knows it’s a public space,” Hommel said.So UCD came up with the idea to create a temporary park out of the space, complete with 50 trees in colorful planters, a meadow, and a wood-chipped walking path. After consulting with OLIN, UCD picked native plants and trees that will acclimate to the site and will hopefully be used in the future permanent public space.Pedestrians will be able to walk through the pop-up meadow next summer, once the construction of 37th, Warren, and Cuthbert Streets is complete. That’s when, Hommel says, “The hope is that we get people to explore this and start wandering around.” Leading with the debut of a project’s public space has become a common trend. In Philly, the Museum of the American Revolution’s plaza opened six months before the actual museum opened. And the first phase of the massive $3.5 billion Schuylkill Yards project, not far from uCity Square, will include the buildout of the 1.5-acre Drexel Square. The redevelopment of the Navy Yard also began with Field Operations’ Central Green. All three efforts have been pegged as a sign of goodwill to the respective neighborhoods. “It doesn’t happen very often, but when it does, it really leads to positive results and not a soulless public space,” says Hommel. “This whole section of the neighborhood is changing and this site is changing,” said Alissa Weiss, UCD’s director of strategic initiatives and communications “To have various opportunities to engage people in the creation of the site and the future of the site is, I think, really exciting and brings people into the process along the way.”With the help of UCD’s own Green City Works initiative team and a partnership with the nonprofit organization Tiny WPA, the future meadow will be created by local hands. The painted tree planter boxes were built in two weeks by Tiny WPA’s Building Hero Project. Meanwhile, Green City Works, which provides landscape training to West Philadelphia residents, is responsible for the planting and maintenance of the meadow. The partnership was an easy decision for Tina WPA’s Alex Gilliam, whose operations are located close to the uCity Square site. “We like to say that we see everything that’s missing in a place: Benches on the sidewalk, bike racks—massive tree boxes that could be individual hot tubs,” he quips, gesturing to the planters scattered throughout the site.  There’s no doubt that a public meadow will be a big upgrade from the site’s current status. But Hommel sees the future community asset as more of a celebration of what’s to come for the neighborhood than a coverup of an ugly construction site. “It’s celebrating all this construction that’s happening,” he said, “and getting people in on it rather than being on the outside. Eventually, when the fences come down, we hope people won’t be saying, ‘Hey it’s not for us.’”"
Museum Estates townhouse at former Please Touch Museum asks $2.15M,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/10/15946996/logan-square-home-for-sale-please-touch-museum,article,"The site of the now-demolished and original Please Touch Museum is still very much a construction site, but the first townhome is already looking for its future owner willing to shell out $2,150,000 for a 4,320-square-foot property. The eight-unit townhouse development, dubbed Museum Estates, isn’t expected to deliver until December 2017, so the listing states that there’s still time to add some of your own customizations to the home. These are the already built-in basics for this particular townhouse, named Unit 3: There will be four bedrooms, four and a half baths, and a two-car garage. Each townhouse also comes with a deck off the second level and a roof deck. The eight mansion-like homes will replace the former Please Touch Museum, which was demolished last year to make way for the new development. The Please Touch Museum is now located in Fairmount Park.

Philadelphia Housing Authority sued by local construction company,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/7/15934352/domus-vs-philadelphia-housing-authority-lawsuit,article,"A local construction company is suing the Philadelphia Housing Authority, claiming that the agency’s decisions caused major delays to their work on the Sharswood Blumberg redevelopment project.DOMUS, which was awarded the $20.9 million contract for project in 2014, claims that PHA failed to pay invoices on time and changed the terms of their contract.The multi-million dollar contract required that DOMUS renovate the remaining Blumberg high-rise tower for senior residents, build 57 rental units, and design new streets in the neighborhood. The construction company claims that decisions made by the PHA delayed much of their work by months.An article in Law360 states: Domus highlights multiple incidents in its complaint against the PHA, including alleged last-minute changes to the designs that required new permits. The PHA also went back on its decision to move a water line that ran through the construction site, delaying the project by several months, the complaint alleged.DOMUS also claims in the lawsuit that after the implosion of the Norman Blumberg apartment towers on the site, they had to delay work “for several weeks” because the implosion didn’t take place on time. In addition, due to delayed payments, the construction company says it had to front $7 million of their own money to keep workers on the job. DOMUS originally filed the lawsuit in March, a few months after it completed construction on the first phase of the project in November 2016. PHA told Curbed Philly in an emailed statement that the alleged claims are unfounded and that it plans to file a counter claim: The facts will show that Domus' claim is without merit. PHA intends to vigorously defend this case and will file a counter claim seeking damages of more than $1 million for numerous delays, poor workmanship and subpar performance by Domus. PHA is eager to present its case and the substantial evidence it has in court. The trial is scheduled to take place next year. Meanwhile, construction in the neighborhood continues, with PHA recently breaking ground on its $45 million headquarters. "
Toll Brothers: Jewelers Row tower to shrink by six stories,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/7/15930770/jewelers-row-tower-toll-brothers-zoning-permit-denied,article,"After a busy start to the year with community meetings, multiple appeals, and potential historic designations come and gone, news about the proposed 29-story tower on Jewelers Row remained relatively quiet over the spring and early summer. But now, after hitting a roadblock with a government agency, the developer says it has the tower has shrunk in size by six stories.Toll Brothers told the Philadelphia Inquirer Thursday that it has decided to build a shorter, 23-story tower. The news came shortly after Licenses & Inspections (L&I) announced that it had closed the developer’s application for a zoning permit due to lack of response from Toll Brothers. “L&I was awaiting additional information in support of Toll’s assertion of unity of use as a justification for the size of the 29-story building,” L&I spokesperson Karen Guss confirmed to Curbed Philly in an e-mail. Earlier this year Toll Brothers had filed an application for a zoning permit to build 29 stories instead of the originally proposed 16, under the “unity of use” argument. This would allow multiple parcels and their air rights to be combined into one, thereby allowing a taller tower to be built. L&I then requested more information from the developer to back up its unity of use argument, and have spent the past few months waiting for a response. With notice that the application’s deadline to respond had expired, Toll Brothers then announced its decision to shorten the tower by six stories. The developer remains as the owner of five properties located on from 702-710 Sansom Street and its demolition permits are still valid. The plan is to raze the five structures to make way for the residential tower, which originally called for 115 units. We’ll continue to update our timeline as this story continues to develop. "
Plan for 71 apartments next to Fishtown Rec Center moves forward,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/6/15924166/wolff-court-apartments-fishtown-rec-center,article,"A mixed-use project that will bring a 71-unit apartment building next to Fishtown Recreation Center has cleared its latest hurdle, receiving the green light from the city’s Civic Design Review committee on Wednesday afternoon. The proposed project, dubbed “Wolff Court” and designed by Harman Deutsch Architecture, calls for the demolition of a couple of structures on the .6-acre site, including the one-story Wolff auto shop at 501 E. Girard Avenue. In its place will be a four-story, brick building with 71 apartments on the second through fourth floors, and ground-floor retail. The apartments will be a mix of studios, one-bedrooms, and two-bedrooms. There will also be amenities like outdoor space, a gym, a movie room, and a dining area for residents. In addition, there will be four ground-level parking spaces for the retail and 47 spaces underground. Another 24 spaces will be for bicycles. The 69,521-square-foot project can be built by-right, but a CDR meeting was triggered because it is proposing 50,000-square-feet of new construction and more than 50 residential units. The committee said there was “a lot to commend” in this project, but the ground-floor retail was especially appreciated. Plans for a 6,000-square-foot fresh market store and two other commercial spaces on the first floor were praised by committee chair and architect Nancy Rogo-Trainer, who said, “We’ve been begging developers to include more commercial space in their projects.” Although the committee’s vote to conclude the CDR process was unanimous, it did express some concerns about certain aspects of the design proposal, namely a six-foot brick wall that will separate the development from the Fishtown Recreation Center’s basketball courts. A taller wall would require a zoning variance, but a representative for the Registered Community Organization (RCO) associated with this project stated that Fishtown residents were concerned with the height of the wall from “a safety perspective,” in that “kids could climb over” the six-foot wall from the basketball court. Committee member Michael Johns also noted his concern and suggested that the designers consider security gates on both the entrance and exit of the one-way vehicular driveway to prevent trespassing.

The rec center is also set to undergo $500,000 worth of renovations. "
30th Street Station to host open house for grand public space,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/5/15921620/30th-street-station-station-plaza-open-house,article,"It’s been more than one year since we last heard anything about the 30th Street Station District Master Plan. That’s when the final master plan was released and in turn went on to win a 2017 AIA award. But on Wednesday, July 12, we’ll learn a little more, when 30th Street Station hosts yet another open house, this time concerning the planned public space dubbed Station Plaza that will surround all sides of the grand train station. The 30th Street Station District team wants community input and feedback on the current plans for what it’s calling Philly’s next “great civic space.” Like with the past open houses held for the master plan, there were be several station plaza designs that the public will be able to peruse and consider—the official website states that there are three alternatives.The feedback gathered from the open house will then be used to help narrow the design concepts down to one. This is the latest step in the $6.5 billion 30th Street Station District Plan, which calls for 18 million square feet of new development around 30th Street Station, a wealth of improvements and renovations to the train station, and 40 acres of public space. According to the master plan’s tentative timeline, Station Plaza will be completed sometime between 2025 and 2030.The open house will be in the North waiting room of 30th Street Station on July 12 from 4:30 to 7 p.m. "
First Look: Inside the 16-story Vue32 residential tower in University City,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/30/15892664/vue32-apartments-photos-tour,article,"All it takes is one look from the rooftop terrace of Vue32 to understand how the 16-story tower got its name. “I think it has one of the best views of downtown Philly,” said developer David Yeager of Radnor Property Group at a recent hard hat tour of the tower.He’s not wrong—although it’s also a telling view of not just Center City’s evolving skyline, but University City’s ongoing rise, too. At 16 stories, one wouldn’t expect Vue32 to offer the same jaw-dropping vistas as, say, the 47-story FMC Tower on the Schuylkill. But its location at 3201 Race Street places it high above the SEPTA rail yard and allows it unblocked views of the rest of the city. It’s what attracted Radnor Property Group to the site. And according to Yeager, 60 percent of the 164 units in Vue32 have views of Center City. Construction began on the $56 million tower (it was originally called View32 until it underwent a rebranding) in March 2016. But that was after months of community meetings and the city’s approval of 14 zoning variances for the project. To accommodate the requests of both neighbors and Drexel University, which is a partner in the project with Radnor Property Group, local architecture firm Erdy McHenry ultimately designed a tower that was slimmer, taller, and slightly rotated east. This positioning helps minimize shadow lines across the neighborhood’s adjacent community garden. It also creates an 11-foot grade change from west to east that allows for handsome stadium seating and a plaza at the foot of the building’s main entrance. In addition, parking for 32 spaces was moved underground, and an 180-person early learning childcare center was reserved for the lower two floors. The building’s smaller footprint—Yeager describes it as a boutique apartment building—means the studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom units are on the smaller size than the average apartment, though they all have nine-foot-tall ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. The units range in price from $1,700 for a 494-square-foot junior one-bedroom unit to $5,100 for a 1,495-square-foot three-bedroom. Yeager says in general the units are 5 percent smaller than apartments at Radnor’s other University City project at 3737 Chestnut. At last count, about 15 to 20 percent of the units have been leased. As expected, they seem to be attracting eds and meds of University City, although Yeager notes that some young professionals who reverse commute out of Philly have expressed interest, due to Vue32’s proximity to 30th Street Station. The story isn’t over for the project. The second phase, which will bring 12 two-bedroom condos next to the tower, is set to break ground later this summer. "
Schuylkill Yards developer commits $5M to West Philly neighborhood initiative,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/27/15879084/schuylkill-yards-affordable-housing-neighborhood-development,article,"The developer of the multi-billion dollar project Schuylkill Yards planned for University City is set to commit $5.6 million into West Philly neighborhoods through a neighborhood initiative, which will include $3.1 million in affordable housing. Brandywine Realty Trust announced today that as part of Phase 1 of the Schuylkill Yards, the Neighborhood Engagement Initiative will directly address and fund five specific areas that neighbors of the future project have highlighted in past community meetings: Boosting small, local, and minority businesses as well as new jobs; affordable housing and preservation; and educational support.The initiative is being touted as the largest program of its kind in Philly and is the result of months of community meetings and talks with neighborhood stakeholders and residents. Brandywine is set to make an official announcement today with Mayor Jim Kenney and Penn Medicine, both who have similar programs underway with Rebuild and PennAssist, respectively. Schuylkill Yards is a $3.5 billion mixed-use project with Brandywine and Drexel University at the helm. The project, which aims to transform West Philadelphia into a leading innovation hub of the region, will be built on 14 acres of land and feature multiple new high-rises dedicated to labs, retail, and residential. Here are the specifics on Brandywine’s initiative: One of the most-voiced concerns among the West Philly community has been how Schuylkill Yards will impact their neighborhoods in terms of housing. In response, the developer said it will commit a multi-million dollar grant to a joint community fund that will then be allocated between Mantua and Powelton neighborhoods. For future development at Schuylkill Yards, five representatives from neighborhood organizations will be a part of a Community Design Advisory Group. And for every planned project, Brandywine will issue a request for proposals (RFP) to West Philly community development corporations and allow them to be co-developers. Brandywine will provide this seed capital to what it’s calling the Grow Philadelphia Capital Fund. In partnership with the Enterprise Center, these funds will be provided directly to City of Philadelphia Minority Enterprises, which will in turn use it to enhance economic and employment opportunities to locals. In addition to the $500,000, a percentage of construction contracts involved with Schuylkill Yards will go toward the fund. Contractors will be required to meet minority and local contracting goals as established by the contract—if they don’t, their fees will be put toward the Grow Philadelphia Capital Fund. In addition, the developer is planning for future Schuylkill Yards tenants to receive a 10 percent discount when they buy from West Philly businesses. The Construction Apprenticeship Preparatory Program (CAPP) will be a 15-week program that will help prep those who want to go into the construction industry; 25 West Philadelphians have already started CAPP and have gone on to pass exams. Of the apprenticeship program, Mayor Jim Kenney said, “Philadelphians who haven’t yet benefitted from our city’s recent development and construction boom, will have the opportunity to partake.”Most recently, Schuylkill Yards earned City Council approval to move forward on the first phase of the project, which will include 4.6 acres of new development: A 1.3-acre park called Drexel Square, the renovation of the Bulletin Building, and the build-out of 3001-03 JFK Boulevard and 3025 JFK Boulevard.Brandywine is expected to break ground on the first phase this summer.

"4 new City Council bills on housing, bike lanes, parking you should know",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/26/15873024/philadelphia-affordable-housing-bike-lanes-parking-requirements,article,"Late last week, Philadelphia City Council introduced and approved a long list of legislation before heading out for summer recess. That included big-ticket items like Mayor Jim Kenney’s Rebuild ordinance, and as well as some lesser-known, but significant bills worth knowing about. Below you’ll find a breakdown of some of the noteworthy ordinances that have either earned City Council approval are still in the very beginning stages. They all have to do with housing, transportation, parking, and the city’s infrastructure. This bill allows the City of Philadelphia to borrow $300 million through a bond from the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development (PAID) in order to fund Mayor Jim Kenney’s Rebuild program. Rebuild is a $500 million investment to improve Philly’s parks, rec centers, and libraries. The Rebuild program is considered a cornerstone of Kenney’s agenda. The bill was sponsored by Council President Darrell Clarke and Councilmember Cindy Bass. Kenney said he plans to sign the bill as soon as it hits his desk. But the City of Philadelphia won’t execute the bond borrowing until the Philadelphia Beverage Tax litigation settles. Just days before the Rebuild vote, the Commonwealth Court ruled in favor of Philly and the beverage tax in a lawsuit filed by the American Beverage Association and local retailers.The bill calls to update Title 7 of the city’s housing code to include an amendment that would require private developers to include permanent affordable housing units in their residential projects. Specifically, they’d be required to build one unit of affordable housing for every nine market-rate housing units; one unit would have be offered on the site itself and tenants of these units would have access to all the same finishes and amenities. Rental units are targeted to households earning 30 to 50 perfect of the area median income, and homes for sale are targeted to those earning 50 to 80 percent. As an incentive, developers would be awarded with bonuses that increase height, density, and floor area ratio limits. They would also have the option to pay the Philadelphia Housing Trust Fund instead. The mixed-income housing bill was put forth by Councilmember Maria Quinones-Sanchez and also sponsored by Council President Darrell Clarke, Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell, and Councilman Kenyatta Johnson. As PlanPhilly noted, “All the sponsors represent districts with large numbers of impoverished residents as well as some of the hottest real estate markets in the city.” It also has the backing of the Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporation (PACDC). Quinones-Sanchez only just introduced the bill on the last City Council session before summer recess, so the next few months will involve some fine-tuning before it goes to vote in the fall. This bill calls to make some changes to the parking requirements in certain districts in Philly. If passed, the parking requirements of multi-family developments would double, requiring six parking spots for every 10 units. The current Philadelphia Code’s “Zoning and Planning” Title 14 calls for three parking spots for every 10 units, which was passed in 2012. The bill is sponsored by Councilmember Bill Greenlee and President Darrell Clarke, who in the past has questioned the current parking requirements. Last year, he said, “Everybody’s not going to ride the train, everybody’s not going to take public transit. This is Philadelphia. People drive to the corner store. This is what we do.”What’s next? The legislation will be voted on in the fall, when City Council returns from summer recess. Bills 170672 and 170289 will bring two long-awaited protected bike lanes to two Philly neighborhoods: One on Chestnut Street between 45th and 34th streets (Bill 170672), and another raised, center lane on American Street between Lehigh Avenue and Jefferson Street (Bill 170289). Bill 170561 will bring a southbound bike lane to 15th Street between Carpenter Street and Washington Avenue. It will be five-feet wide.Councilmember Jannie Blackwell sponsored Bill 170400 and Councilmember Maria Quiñones Sánchez is the sponsor of Bill 170289. Councilmember Johnson is the sponsor of the 15th Street bike lane. With City Council’s approval, the three bills now are in the hands of the mayor for final approval. The Bicycle Coalition notes that they are also hoping to eventually get the Chestnut Street lane extended to Cobb’s Creek and connect to Center City. "
Views at Penn Treaty townhomes list for $1.7M,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/26/15872848/views-at-penn-treaty-townhomes-for-sale,article,"A trio of townhomes located in the future Views at Penn Treaty development have hit the market to the tune of $1.7 million each, with two already selling over the weekend. The listings come less than week after New York developer Gotham Bedrock LLC announced that it had bought a 1.5-acre parcel of land at 1143-51 N. Delaware Avenue from Shovel Ready Projects for $7 million. The already-designed project calls for 19 luxury townhomes on the waterfront. The three townhomes, listed under Keller Williams agent Jacob Cohen, all feature three bedrooms and three full and one half bathrooms. Each one clocks in at 3,966 square feet. In general, the Views at Penn Treaty townhomes are being marketed toward “the most discerning buyer.” The amenity-laden homes all come with high-end finishes and features like bi-level roof decks, two-car garages, and elevators. There are also different options for future owners to choose from, including the choice between light or dark cabinetry in the kitchen or bathroom. Although the site does allow for higher-density projects, the developers said in their announcement that the current real estate market “demands for premium town homes.” These three homes are being sold at pre-construction sales, so expect that price tag to get bumped up as build-out begins, which is expected immediately. The whole development is aiming for a winter 2017 completion date. "
Heres what to expect when Pier 9 re-opens in 2018,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/23/15855936/delaware-river-waterfront-pier-9-cherry-street-pier-renderings,article,"Don’t call it Pier 9: A long-abandoned pier on the Delaware River Waterfront is set to undergo a major $4 million makeover. It’s new name? Cherry Street Pier. The Delaware River Waterfront Corporation (DRWC) announced yesterday that with a $683,000 grant from the Knight Foundation, it will renovate and re-open Pier 9 as a creative community space, complete with an open-air garden, food vendors, pop-up retail markets, and shipping containers-turned-offices. Under the new name Cherry Street Pier, the 93-year old warehouse will be renovated and restored under the design leadership of Interface Studio Architects (ISA) and Groundswell, the same firm behind the massively popular Spruce Street Harbor Park and Delaware RiverRink Summer and Winter fests, both located on the river. The news comes at a key turning point for the Delaware River waterfront. Earlier this month the DRWC also announced that the $225 million Penn’s Landing/I-95 capping project would be moving forward, with the last remaining $10 million committed by the City of Philadelphia, the State of Pennsylvania, and the William Penn Foundation. That massive undertaking is still years away, so Cherry Street Pier will be DWRC’s next project to come to fruition. The pier has sat vacant for decades, although last year it served as the backdrop for fabric artist Ann Hamilton’s ethereal “Habitus” exhibit. It was the first time the pier had been open to the public in years. “Cherry Street Pier is the latest example of the vision of the Master Plan coming to fruition, and will contribute to the ongoing resurgence of the Delaware River Waterfront,” said DWRC’s in-coming president Joe Forkin in a statement. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of what to expect at Cherry Street Pier, when it opens it late spring or summer of next year. At the entrance of Cherry Street Pier will be a section called the Garage, which will be home to 14 shipping containers stacked on top of one another. These big boxes, ranging from 160 to 480 square feet, will serve as office space for creative entrepreneurs who can sign on for flexible leases. Also available for lease will be spaces for vendors to set up shop and sell their own goods. Like the offices, leases will be flexible: Market place vendors will be able to rent a space just for the afternoon, multiple days, or longer. The middle of the pier will be reserved for the Platform, a big space that will be dedicated to art installations, performances, and other public events. The end of the pier will undoubtedly offer some pretty breathtaking views of the river. The plan is to remove the roofing in this section in order to expose the pier’s trestles and open sky. Dubbed the Garden, this area will be sectioned off from the rest of the space via a glass wall and feature seating, tables, and some foliage.The Inquirer’s Inga Saffron noted that the $4 million project has to go through the Art Commission and Philadelphia Historical Commission, but DWRC says work is expected to begin as soon as late summer.

Philadelphia Housing Authority breaks ground on $45M headquarters in Sharswood,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/22/15852458/philly-housing-headquarters-groundbreaking-sharswood,article,"The Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) broke ground yesterday on its planned $45 million new headquarters at 2013 Ridge Avenue. The multi-phase project, known to some as Sharswood-Blumberg, will first bring a six-story building to the site that will be the new home of the PHA. Later phases will include mixed-use buildings, retail, and residential units to the triangular site, as well.The groundbreaking comes after a somewhat rocky response from the design community last year. The PHA presented its design proposal for the six-story building twice to the Civic Design Review. The committee hoped for a design that was less suburban, and commented on the lack of communication between the two city agencies. PHA says the hope is that its new headquarters will be an economic driver for the revitalization of Sharswood. The North Philly neighborhood is currently in the middle of a $500 million redevelopment transformation that aims to bring 1,200 residential units and a retail corridor along Ridge Avenue to the area. In addition, PHA recently acquired the local Vaux High School, which is set to re-open this year. Construction on the PHA headquarters is expected to finish up in the fall of 2018. "
Why Callowhill is Phillys next fast-emerging neighborhood,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/22/15846412/callowhill-neighborhood-to-watch-philadelphia,article,"In 2016, the number of construction permits pulled for the Callowhill neighborhood doubled year over year. The number of property sales nearly tripled between 2010 and 2015. All the while, Callowhill’s population boomed as more young working professionals moved into the neighborhood. It doesn’t take more than a quick walk around the neighborhood to come to the conclusion that Callowhill is on the rise. That’s the consensus of a new report by FixList and research analytics firm JLL, which deemed Callowhill, a once troubled neighborhood that served as inspiration for David Lynch’s film Eraserhead, as a fast-emerging market with plenty of room to grow, even with its already rapid transformation. For all intents and purposes, Greater Callowhill is defined as the area between Vine, Spring Garden, North Broad, and North 2nd streets. A couple of key details from their findings:Between 2010 and 2015, the number of properties that sold increased by nearly three-fold, from 150 to 440 properties, and many of them are zoned for high-density use. This is in response to the area’s new zoning overlay, which allows for more high-density construction in what has been typically an industrial-zoned neighborhood. Although property sales have tripled and issued construction permits have doubled year over year, the report found that there is still 400,000 square feet of undeveloped land in the Greater Callowhill area. These findings are no surprise to developer Craig Grossman, whose company Arts and Crafts Holdings has been buying up Callowhill properties and restoring them since 2015. At last count, Grossman says his team has acquired a dozen properties up and down 10th Street, a collection referred to as the Spring Arts District. “We really started here in 2015, and I think a lot of our reasoning for investing here was instinctual,” Grossman said in an interview with Curbed Philly. “I think we were looking at the topography of the city, and we could see there was all of this energy taking place in this concentric circle.”At the time, Northern Liberties to the east was already booming, he continued. Chinatown was expanding North, North Broad’s renaissance was underway, and the redevelopment of the Rail Park, which cuts right through Callowhill, was imminent. “It became very clear to us that this was an area that had been passed over for decades,” Grossman said. “We felt like if we could fill it in, or at least do our part in igniting change here, you could begin to knit together the other neighborhoods.”The boom of Callowhill is especially apparent in its changing demographics. The FixList/JLL report notes that the neighborhood’s total population skyrocketed between 2010 and 2014 by 30 percent—that’s 10 times faster than Philly’s population growth as a whole. Furthermore, millennials and young working professionals make up a good chunk of that growth.This demographic tends to be attracted to the office environment that Arts and Crafts and other developers have created, converting old and often historic warehouses into creative working spaces. 990 Spring Garden, for example, is now home to companies like EducationWorks, Boco, and Azavea, which all have direct access to the new Roy Pitz Brewery on the first floor. There’s also the fact that as Center City’s leasing rates climb higher, tenants find Callowhill’s comparatively affordable rates much more reasonable. The average price per square foot here is $21. The highest office rents in Center City are about $31 per square foot, according to Center City District’s latest report. “If you can offer an interesting product close to public transportation, close to entertainment, and walkable to the Central Business District at a price that almost feels like we’re on sale over here, it becomes a very compelling argument,” said Grossman. “I think that’s opening up a lot of eyes and leading to attracting folks up here.”Callowhill’s growth is far from over, the FixList/JLL report concluded: “We anticipate continued, ongoing interest in both residential and office development in this fast-emerging neighborhood,” the researchers wrote.Indeed, a number of big-time tenants are planning to set up shop in the Greater Callowhill area, including Target and Yards Brewery at 6th and Spring Garden. Meanwhile, an entire neighborhood within a neighborhood, marketed as Callow East, holds plenty of potential for development, too. Grossman says it’s about time. He harkens back to his first walk around the neighborhood a few years ago: “It’s rich with history and for one reason or another, it’s been overlooked.”"
Salvation Army building update: Construction prep underway on 14 apartments,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/22/15845684/salvation-army-building-apartments-society-hill,article,"After languishing on the market for years, the old Salvation Army building at S. 3rd Street and Willings Alley in Society Hill is now showing some signs of life. A recent visit to the site revealed that scaffolding has gone up around portions of the hulking stone building, a sign that construction, or at the very least facade work, is underway to convert it into 14 apartments. That’s been the plan, at least, since late 2015, when zoning notices went up at the property. Architecture firm Canno Design confirmed to Curbed Philly that those plans are still in place. Meanwhile, construction has been ongoing for months now right next door, where a collection of four high-end townhomes are being built under the name Estates on 3rd. These four-story homes, with starting prices at $2.65 million, have replaced the Salvation Army’s former daycare and cafeteria.Both projects were designed by Canno Design. Here’s a rendering of the Estates on 3rd. The firm tells us that there are no renderings currently available of the proposed apartments. "
1213 Walnut update: 26-story tower now pre-leasing for August move-ins,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/20/15836380/fergie-tower-1213-walnut-philadelphia-leasing-information,article,"After topping out in January at 285 feet, the 26-story tower 1213 Walnut has started pre-leasing its 322 luxury apartments and is expected to be ready for early August move-ins. Curbed Philly recently got a sneak peek of the tower in Washington Square West (the real estate and development world refers to this area as Midtown Village). While the 300,000-square-foot tower is still very much a construction zone, Todd Malligan, Goldenberg Group’s vice president of construction and development, says everything is on track for the first tenants to move in by the end of July or early August and for construction to finish up by late summer or early fall. “We really just have cosmetic work to do,” Malligan said. 1213 Walnut, often referred to as the “Fergie Tower” due to its proximity to the Fergie Pub on Sansom Street, broke ground in December 2015 and topped out in January 2016. The tower is by far the tallest building on the block. Malligan says that’s why a large retail presence both on Walnut and Sansom streets was important. “The neighborhood is really the building’s best amenity, so we wanted to engage the neighborhood by keeping activity on the street,” he said. Indeed, the first two stories of the tower on Walnut Street will consist of a 6,000-square-foot restaurant. Malligan says the tenant is still to be determined. Above the restaurant is a community terrace for residents of 1213 Walnut. The project also includes a covered driveway from Walnut to Sansom Street, which will be accented by a CorTen steel wall with planters and accessible to the public.   The entrance to the residential building will be on this side street, as well. Malligan says one idea for the covered street is to close it to traffic and host the occasional block party. The residential portion of 1213 Walnut features a wealth of amenities, including a fireplace in the two-story lobby, and an amenity level that takes up the entire second floor of the building and features wood accents throughout made of, fittingly, Walnut. On that level, there will be three community outdoor spaces (there are four total in the building), including one for the fitness center, a dog run, and the community terrace fronting Walnut Street. The 322 apartments include studios, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom units that range in price from $1,819 for a 433-square-foot studio to $3,604 for an 830-square-foot two-bedroom rental. The 25th floor will include penthouse units with terraces facing both east and west. The hard hat tour of recently finished model units revealed floor-to-ceiling windows, and the option for residents to choose between two different interior finishes: One offers darker Italian-crafted cabinetry and flooring than the other. But of all of the high-end features and amenities at the tower, perhaps the most telling one is that the project does not include parking, although some residents will have access to the Parkway Parking garage next door. That move was purposeful for Goldenberg Group and Hines Development, who from the beginning marketed 1213 Walnut as a walkable mixed-use project. Indeed, the December 2015 groundbreaking opted out of the traditional shovel-to-ground ceremony and instead installed bike racks along Sansom Street.“Once upon a time, not having a parking garage with a project of this size was a non-starter,” Malligan said. “But we have to evolve with the urban renter professional and create spaces that can evolve. We wanted to reflect the persona of the neighborhood.” "
New renderings of Headhouse Square expansion revealed,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/19/15829652/headhouse-square-society-hill-renovation-renderings,article,"Headhouse Square in Society Hill recently cleared the latest hurdle needed to begin work on its long-awaited makeover and expansion.Earlier this month, the Art Commission approved the latest design plans for the renovation of Headhouse Square, a project that has been in years in the making, PlanPhilly reported. The approved plan, designed by Ambit Architecture, calls for the creation of an actual plaza, accompanied by pedestrian-safety measures, like more lighting. In addition, two canopy-like pavilions will be built on both ends of the new plaza. One-fourth of the 40 parking spots will be removed to make way for more green space, too, PlanPhilly noted. Why the need for change? It’s been some six decades since any updates have been made to Headhouse Square, of which the current structure is a National Historic Landmark. The goal is for the space to serve as a more welcoming gateway for the retail corridor and be more pedestrian-friendly. With the Art Commission approval, work will likely begin in the next few months, although the design team will have to return once more for approval of the proposed public artwork. Ambit Architecture shared plenty of renderings of the Headhouse Square renovations, giving us a good idea of what to expect with the expansion. "
NY developers buy site next to Penn Treaty Park for $7M,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/19/15828766/views-at-penn-treaty-townhome-community-sold,article,"With the purchase of a 1.5-acre parcel along the Delaware River waterfront, work on a 19-townhome development near Penn Treaty Park is set to begin immediately. New York-based developers Gotham Bedrock LLC announced that it has bought the land at 1143-51 N. Delaware Avenue from Shovel Ready Projects for $7 million and plans to begin construction on the turnkey project immediately. Originally called marketed as Penn Treaty Views, the development parcel and its design plans and permits first hit the market in March for $6.5 million. The Gotham Bedrock project is being called The Views at Penn Treaty, and will include four-story townhouses ranging from 3,800 to 5,500 square feet. Each townhouse will come with a two-car garage, an elevator, and a roof deck.  Gotham Bedrock’s Alex Halimi and Saul Mazor will be the first New York developers—the majority of their work has been in Brooklyn—to break ground on the Delaware River waterfront, which in just the last few months has seen a resurgence in interest from both local and out-of-town developers. The nearby Philadelphia Piers, for example, were also recently purchased by NY-developer Durst Organization. ""The reality of New York is that the cap rates are insane and in Brooklyn there is a major scarcity of supply,"" said Halimi in a statement. ""Looking nearby it's tough because in New Jersey the taxes are too high. So Philadelphia is very attractive.”He also noted that the energy of Philadelphia reminds them of Brooklyn, and that the 10 percent tax abatement rate also factored into their purchase, which was handled by the Cohen Team of Keller Williams Realty.

Latest 1911 Walnut plans include mixed-income housing,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/15/15808040/1911-walnut-mixed-income-housing-affordable,article,"The latest plans for the 48-story 1911 Walnut tower in Rittenhouse Square call for some mixed-income units, including some below-market rate units in the glassy mixed-use tower. PlanPhilly reports that developer Southern Land Company plans to have “at least eight” below-market rate units available in the 48-story luxury high-rise, located among the first 10 floors. These units will be in addition to the already announced 28 low-income units that will be located in two historic properties on the site, Rittenhouse Square Coffeehouse and the Warwick. “We could end up with more than 36 units of affordable,” said Neil Sklaroff, a zoning lawyer who represents the Southern Land Company at this week’s planning commission meeting. He went on to say that they are “likely” to meet or surpass the project’s 10 percent mixed-income housing requirement that would allow them to acquire zoning bonuses, according to PlanPhilly’s report. Meanwhile, construction work is underway at the future 1911 Walnut tower. The first step will be the demolition of the Oliver H. Bair Funeral Home. "
Schuylkill Yards first phase clears latest hurdle with City Council committee,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/14/15799888/schuylkill-yards-city-council-bill-approval,article,"There’s still a lot of work to do before shovels can get put to ground, but the Schuylkill Yards project proposed for University City has cleared its latest hurdle with a City Council committee, pushing the $3.5 billion project forward. A City Council committee voted yesterday to approve a bill to begin work on the first phase of the Schuylkill Yards, which will include the creation of a 1.3-acre elliptical park, renovation of the existing Bulletin Building, and more design and development work, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. But some members of the public who spoke at the meeting yesterday expressed their concerns about the project’s influence on their neighborhoods and stating that the developer Brandywine Realty Trust should provide more affordable housing surrounding Schuylkill Yards. Brandywine’s Realty Trust’s CEO Jerry Sweeney said he has committed $2.1 million in affordable housing. The neighbors want four times that amount, according to the Inquirer’s report. Schuylkill Yards is being proposed by Brandywine and Drexel University as a multi-billion dollar project that will transform West Philadelphia into a leading mixed-use, innovation hub of the region on 14 acres of land. Although the bill has committee approval, it still requires final approval from City Council, which could take place June 22. If that approval goes through, the plan is for the developer to break ground this year. "
Proposed Delaware River waterfront zoning bill to be delayed,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/13/15790234/delaware-river-waterfront-zoning-bill-delay,article,"After the developer requested that it be held, a proposed zoning bill that would have allowed taller buildings to be constructed on the Delaware River waterfront will be delayed. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Councilman Mark Squilla planned to shelve the bill after developer K4 Associates announced that it was requesting that the bill be held. K4 Associates has big plans to build the Liberty on the Square development on long-vacant parcels along the Delaware River in Pennsport. The multi-phase project would cover 18 acres—almost all of the land between Washington Avenue and Reed Street—and will bring 10 residential high-rises, 100 townhouses, and one 22-story hotel to the site. Earlier this year, Councilman Squilla proposed the bill that would amend the current Central Delaware Overlay zoning district to allow for construction of taller buildings in the area. It would have benefited the Liberty on the Square development, but the bill was met with protests from those who argued that it undermined the current Central Delaware waterfront master plan. The Inquirer reported that the developers said they plan to work with the neighborhood residents over the summer on the zoning bill and project’s plans. K4 Associates have also applied for $44 million in RACP state grants for the project. You can read the proposed bill in full here. "
"Penns Landing update: Last $10 million committed for I-95 capping, park project",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/10/15774912/penns-landing-park-capping-project-cost-timeline,article,"What was once thought of a pipe dream is set to become reality: The state of Pennsylvania, City of Philadelphia, and the William Penn Foundation have committed to raising the last $10 million needed for the the Penn’s Landing capping and civic spaces project. In an announcement on Friday, Governor Tom Wolfe, Mayor Jim Kenney, and Janet Haas of the William Penn Foundation announced that they have collectively committed to raise the remaining $10 million of the $225 million project, with the foundation stating that it’s “confident that these funds will be secured in a timely fashion.” The news comes a few months after Kenney originally pledged $90 million toward the project in March. Days after, the William Penn Foundation and PennDOT each committed $15 million and $100 million. With the Friday announcement came a slew of new renderings by Hargreaves and Associates for the proposed project, as well as a few new key details about what’s to come, including 1,500 new housing units, 500 hotel rooms, and more than 100,000-square-feet of retail, restaurants, and entertainment. Four acres of I-95 will be capped over, running between Walnut and Chestnut Streets. This area will include a nice ice-skating rink, spray pools, and cafe, and the Irish and Scottish memorials. Also between Walnut and Chestnut will be an eight-acre space that will slope down from the east side of Columbus Boulevard to the river, replacing the	40-year-old deteriorated Great Plaza.The South Street Bridge will feature an “architecturally distinctive extension from its current terminus on the west side of Columbus to the Penn’s Landing Marina.” A two-mile on-road section of the Delaware River Trail will be built from Spring Garden Street to Washington Avenue.One person that’s been waiting for this moment for a long time is John Brady, the president and CEO of the Independence Seaport Museum, which is located right between the Blue Cross RiverRink and Spruce Street Harbor Park. “It’s really a game changer,” the museum CEO told Curbed Philly in an interview prior to the Friday announcement. “We’re completely enthusiastic about the park and think it will be transformation for us as well, and the waterfront in general.”The Independence Seaport Museum into its current location in the mid-1990s, after starting out as a shop on a barge on the Delaware River. “We’ve been a presence and an attraction here through thick and thin, and so it’s nice to see it finally pay off,” Brady said. One of the most important reasons for the $225 million project that the DWRC and Brady both agree with is that it will bring some much-needed accessibility to and from the waterfront. When the I-95 highway was built in the 1970s, it negatively affected the city and residents in that it became a literal barrier to the waterfront and thereby development. That divide is expected to be remedied with the proposed four-acre capping, the extension of the South Street Bridge, and construction of new trails. “I’ve always thought that we are in the perfect location for our mission,” said Brady, “and the only issue has been the perception that we’re separate from the city.” Since PennPraxis released its master plan for the Central Delaware waterfront, Brady and his team at the museum have been spending the past few years firming up its own plans to improve its space along the waterfront to keep in step with it’s ongoing and future transformation. Brady has kept a close eye on the successes of programming like Spruce Street Harbor Park, as well as Washington Avenue Green, Pier 68, and Race Street Pier. The museum CEO envisions renovations to the current structure that will bring more glass “to make it more friendly and allow people to see in and out—we obviously have fantastic views of both the river and the park, and we would really like to make changes to the building that play to that.” The design process, including wrangling permits and construction documents, is expected to wrap up by the end of 2019, while construction is expected to take about three years, the DWRC said.Brady says, “Once the park is in, the location is just going to be spectacular and it moves from being a place that’s just important for what we do to being a place in the city that I’ve got to visit.” "
Developer eyes huge mixed-use project for South Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/8/15761552/girard-estates-apartments-south-quarter-crossing-renderings,article,"A developer that already owns a large swath of land in Southwest Philly has plans to transform it into a 1,000,000-square-foot mixed-use development that’s being marketed as a new neighborhood called South Quarter Crossing. Cedar Realty Trust, which owns the Quartermaster Plaza and South Philadelphia Shopping Center on the edge of the Girard Estates neighborhood, said it has started pre-leasing efforts for its planned project, reports the Inquirer. Indeed, the developer’s website has a pretty lengthy marketing brochure available that’s chockfull of renderings and information on the proposed project. Some key stats: Here’s how the current site would change, if this plan moves forward. Above is an aerial view from Passyunk Avenue, looking south toward the proposed development. The five-story buildings would be a mix of residential and office space. This rendering reveals a two-way alley between the two five-story residential buildings, with ground-floor retail. Girard Estates is a mostly residential neighborhood that’s been described as an affordable “pocket of suburbia.” But the large site at 2301-11 Oregon Avenue is currently zoned CA-2, or auto-oriented commercial district, so this scope and size of a project would have to go through zoning, the Civic Design Review, and community meetings to move forward.

Coworking venture Spaces signs big lease at Hale Building,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/8/15758024/hale-building-coworking-spaces,article,"Spaces, an international coworking company, has signed on as the major tenant for the historic Hale Building on Chestnut Street. The Inquirer first reported the news about the 37,735-square-foot lease, which was handled by the real estate services firm CBRE. Spaces will set up shop on the third through eighth stories of the Willis G. Hale-designed building, and will have exclusive access to the planned roof top deck. As for the first and second floors of the Hale, those will be reserved for a yet-to-be-determined restaurant. The news comes shortly after restoration work began on the Hale Building, located at 1326 Chestnut Street. Currently, the block of Juniper Street is closed to vehicles, as construction workers restore the facade. The exterior work is expected to last until the end of this year. Spaces will be an interesting addition to this stretch of Chestnut Street, which has seen a renewed investment in recent years, especially from developer Brickstone Realty, which owns the Hale. Brickstone also brought the Yard, a Brooklyn-based coworking venture, to the historic Steele building a few blocks away on 11th and Ludlow. Here’s the latest look on progress over at the Hale.

Want to build in Old City? Theres a guide for that,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/6/15742504/old-city-design-building-guide,article,"Want to build in Old City? There’s now a guide for that. Old City District has rolled out its 48-page Old City Design Guide that’s aimed to serve as a reference for developers, architects, and entrepreneurs who want to set up shop in one way or another in the historic district. “We have created this Design Guide to provide property owners and developers with guidance regarding how they can make the most of their investments and ensure that the whole of Old City is greater than the sum of its parts,” Old City District’s executive director Job Itzkowitz said in an announcement. The guide’s publication comes at a time when Old City is in the middle of a building boom for both housing and retail. The district estimates that at the neighborhood’s current growth, anywhere from 200 to 300 housing units could come online annually. The design guide, in fact, is part of Old City District’s larger Vision2026, a framework for neighborhood’s growth and development. When coming up with that framework, concerns raised from stakeholders, residents, and business owners about maintaining the neighborhood’s historic fabric influenced Old City District to come up with a tool to help developers and architects “strike the right balance” in future projects. Urban planner Jonas Maciunas helped Old City District come up with the design guide. There are helpful sections that lay out the neighborhood’s zoning codes and minimum parking requirements, but the majority of the reference guide focuses on a series of recommendations that encourage development that’s made to last, create and support the community, and provide public space. And yes, it does highlight some examples of new builds and repurposed buildings in Old City, highlighting both the good and the bad.Itzkowitz tells Curbed Philly he’s not aware of other local design guides of its kind that have been released by a neighborhood district. The Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia does have its own design guidelines for new construction in historic districts, and other neighborhoods like Rittenhouse Square also have guides for property owners that offer information on how to maintain their historic properties.

The National site in Old City will finally break ground this week,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/6/15741196/national-site-old-city-groundbreaking,article,"After decades of dashed hopes and proposals come and gone, work has finally begun on a mixed-use development project at the site of the former National building in Old City. New owners, Buccini/Pollin Group of Wilmington, Delaware, announced that on Friday, June 10, they will officially break ground on their six-story building, which will bring 192 apartments and 2,000 square feet of retail to 130 N. 2nd Street. No doubt it will be a site for sore eyes in the neighborhood when it finishes construction in summer 2018. Old City has spent years waiting for the redevelopment of this site, which sits at the end of Elfreth’s Alley, one of the most highly foot-trafficked areas in the neighborhood. Formerly home to the National Products Building company, numerous proposals and owners have come and gone, until the building was eventually demolished in 2015. Since then, the site has remained an empty pit.Buccini/Pollin Group bought the property in 2016. It will be the developer’s first apartment project in Philly. Vice president Boris Kaplan acknowledged the site’s ongoing development saga in a statement:“This development has been in the works for decades and we are eager to see The National join the incredible array of residential and recreational amenities in Old City,” he said. “We are treating this project with great care in recognition of the historic fabric of the surrounding community.”Architect Barton Partners have designed a project that incorporates the National’s iconic orange tile and stainless steel signage into the facade facing 2nd Street. And like most new apartment buildings popping up around Philly, this development will be amenity-driven, with a fitness center, pet spa, 60-car garage, two-story clubhouse, and a roof deck. As the rendering suggests, there will also be a public plaza at the foot of the new building, serving as a much more welcome entrance to Elfreth’s Alley."
Demo prep for Oliver H. Bair Funeral home underway,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/30/15712114/1911-walnut-construction-demolition-update,article,"After more than a year of community meetings and a large lot that has remained vacant, expect to see some construction work happening around 1911 Walnut. A Curbed reader tipped us off with a photo taken May 19 that construction equipment has appeared at the vacant lot, which will eventually be the site of a 47-story mixed-use residential tower developed by Southern Land Company. Developer Tim Downey confirmed to Curbed Philly that the equipment is prep for the demolition of the historic Oliver H. Bair Funeral home, which sits on Sansom Street and will be razed to make way for the tower. The Historical Commission approved a financial hardship petition in March, due to the structure’s deteriorating state. While the funeral home will be demolished, the two other buildings, Rittenhouse Square Coffee and the Warwick apartments, will be preserved and turned into affordable housing. "
Developer eyes Ritz Five in Society Hill for next high-rise project,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/30/15711504/ritz-five-condo-tower-society-hill-scannapieco,article,"As his 26-story tower 500 Walnut inches its way toward completion, developer Tom Scannapieco is eyeing the nearby Ritz Five movie theater for his next big project. Earlier this month, the developer presented plans to build a tower at 214 Walnut Street to the Society Hill Civic Association. According to the Philadelphia Free Press, Scannapieco said the proposed tower would be similar to 500 Walnut in that it would include a small number of units—30 to 50—that would come at a high price per square foot. The plan also calls for a low-rise use of the Nelson building next door. Scannapieco is also working again with architect Cecil Baker, who designed 500 Walnut. The proposal is still very much in the beginning stages, but at the meeting there were talks of moving the Ritz Five—one of the few movie theaters in the city—into the Nelson building, according to Naked Philly. Scannapieco has not bought the theater just yet. The theater was built in 1976 and designed by Geddes, Brecher, Qualls & Cunningham, the same firm responsible for the Brutalist Police Administration’s “Roundhouse” building. A residential tower would certainly be an interesting addition to the area, which right now consists of a cobblestoned intersection of Walnut and Dock streets that includes the Ritz Five, the restaurant Positano, and the historic Merchant’s Exchange building. The Society Hill Towers are within plain view, too. Notably, the Nelson building is also next door to a single-family residence at 232-36 Walnut Street. When it listed for $16,795,000 million in September 2016, it was the most expensive home for sale in the city. It failed to find a buyer, but it re-listed in early May prior to the Society Hill meeting at the same price."
Proposed 38-story office tower at 1301 Market is now leasing ,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/26/15697446/1301-market-office-tower-leasing-information-philadelphia,article,"At the end of 2016, it was announced that a glassy, 38-story office tower designed by Skidmore, Owings, & Merrill (SOM) was going to replace a parking lot across the street from City Hall. And although it will be another three years before doors open, the tower has already started leasing. Oliver Tyrone Pulver (OTP) has announced that JLL will be the exclusive leasing agent for the tower at 1301 Market Street, which is being touted as the first large block of trophy office space to become available in Center City.The announcement also offered a few more details about the proposed tower’s amenities. There will be two roof top terraces—one will be on the fifth floor—a fitness area, a conference center, and retail and restaurant on the ground floor.In addition, the tower will feature a glass-enclosed podium that will include a double-height lobby. The tower’s location is worth pointing out, too. 1301 Market will join a string of new developments popping up and down Market East—East Market and the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia—which was just named the most affordable retail corridor in the country. OTP’s president Donald Pulver acknowledged the office tower’s location in a statement, while adding that the goal is for 1301 Market to become the “most productive workspace available today.” A marketing brochure for the tower points out the tower’s floor-to-ceiling windows, 20,425-square-foot, column-free floor plates, and new technology. The 840,000-square-foot tower is expected to be move-in ready by early 2020. "
"Workforce housing debuts in East Poplar, more planned for Francisville",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/25/15682092/workforce-housing-philadelphia-east-poplar-francisville,article,"At a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Wednesday, the city of Philadelphia saw the initial fruits of its workforce housing initiative delivered. Thirteen homes in East Poplar were unveiled at the ceremony, all pre-sold and built at an extremely rapid clip of six months after breaking ground in November 2016. Another 32 homes in nearby Francisville are on the way. It’s all part of City Council president Darrell Clarke’s pet project that was first announced back in 2014. His workforce housing initiative was created in partnership with the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority to turn the Philly’s many city-owned vacant lots into housing for the workforce. To be clear, workforce housing isn’t the same as affordable housing. The former is meant for local residents who earn up to 120 percent of the area median income. A big step forward toward making sure every Philadelphian is able to live in a community of choice. Thanks to our partners @PRA_Phila & BMK! pic.twitter.com/WXWrFN1urGAs developer Mo Rushdy describes it, “It’s geared toward Philadelphians [...] working in the city who are missing the boat on the new construction that’s going up everywhere because everything is in the upper $300,000’s and $400,000’s.” He continues, “They’re simply caught in the middle where they can’t afford to buy a new house and also don’t qualify for some sort of housing assistance program.”Rushdy and his partner Lawrence McKnight of BMK Properties, a subsidiary of River Wards Group, were awarded the PRA’s request for proposals (RFP) to build 13 townhomes located along the 900 and 1000 blocks of N. Marshall Street in East Poplar. “We didn’t try to cheapen house to increase the mortgage,” Rushdy told Curbed Philly, ahead of the ribbon cutting ceremony. “We did what we’ve done for our past million-dollar homes: Hardwood floors throughout, granite counter tops, and stainless steel appliances.” Says Rushdy, “The city liked what we offering and that’s how we got awarded the project.”The developers worked with KJO Architecture to design a mix of 2- to 3-story townhomes clocking in between 1,100 and 1,200 square feet, all with private backyards. No parking was included; Rushdy said that’s due to the homes’ proximity to public transportation and the fact that the homes were not built as one cohesive development.Every home was priced at $229,999, and all 13 buyers went through a rigorous application process with the PRA prior to finalizing sales. This won’t be the last of workforce housing Philly sees coming to its rapidly developing neighborhoods. Similar plans are in store for the 32-home Francisville project, says Rushdy, who was also awarded the RFP. Construction is expected to begin in the fall if zoning is approved. The PRA recently issued another RFP for a 15-parcel workforce housing development in West Poplar. This time, the RFP includes a credit enhancement for developers, which will provide a 25 percent guarantee to the financial institution that issues the construction loans. That may incentivize more developers to take on these kind of projects, which can often be complicated or limited given the budget constraints, says Rushdy. But, he adds, “We’re on the way of seeing a lot of these pop up.”"
Philly police to move into old Inquirer building on North Broad,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/24/15685776/philadelphia-police-headquarters-relocation-inquirer-building,article,"The rumors are true: Philly’s new police headquarters will not be in West Philly, but instead at the old Inquirer building on North Broad in a $290 million deal. City officials made the announcement today at City Hall, where Anne Fadullon, director of planning and development for the city, said, “As many of you may be aware, when the Kenney administraiton came into office in 2016, one of the first tasks was to look into the police’s move into 4601 Market Street. [...] Through the course of doing due diligence, we landed on 400 N. Broad Street.” The news comes months after rumors emerged that the police was rethinking its original plan to move into the Provident Mutual Life Insurance building in West Philly from its current headquarters at the “Roundhouse” at 750 Race Street. The move was spearheaded under the former Nutter administration. When Mayor Jim Kenney took office in January 2016, the historic West Philly building at 4601 Market was already deep into its renovations, as part of the master plan to move the police, the medical examiner's office and morgue, and the Department of Health Laboratory Services to the 15-acre property. By now, $50 million has been spent on the project. Fadullon said that while she couldn’t speak to the former administration’s reasoning for choosing 4601 Market Street, 400 N. Broad Street was an attractive site for the police due to its size and location. While the West Philly building is quite literally at the foot of the 46th Street Station on the Market-Frankford line, Fadullon argued that 400 N. Broad is accessible via more public transportation modes. Police commissioner Richard Ross also noted that North Broad provides a more central location for the police force, especially those traveling from Northeast Philly. “There’s no easy way for them to get to 4601 Market,” he said. “Pretty much everyone at 8th and Race is excited.” Employees will also have access to the parking structure adjacent to 400 N. Broad, which can has 590 spaces. The 4601 Market site did not have “a sufficient amount of parking,” according to officials. In addition, the 400 N. Broad building offers 100,000 square feet of more space compared to 4601 Market. The additional space will allow the city to put more units than originally planned under one roof, including the 6th and 9th police districts, the fire and police communications department, and additional office space. “It’s the same cost, but we’re getting more product,” Fadullon said. The cost of the project is estimated to be $290 million, which includes the lease that it will sign with the building’s current private owner, Bart Blatstein of Tower Investments. The city will lease the building through its renovations, which will allow the developer to make use of historic tax credits. Publicly-owned entities are not allowed to take advantage of these credits, Fadullon noted. It will then purchase the property from Blatstein at a price that is included in the $290 million budget. While the move is certainly a boon for already-booming North Broad, it’s a bit of a blow for West Philly. But Bridget Greenwald of the Department of Public Property said that private developers have already expressed interest in 4601 Market Street, with ideas of turning the building into residential, commercial, or office space.The city said it plans to issue an RFQ this summer for 4601 Market, and a bid will be awarded by December 31, 2017. It also plans to sell three current city-owned facilities, including the Roundhouse, the medical examiner’s office in University City, and the 6th Police District building on 11th and Vine. Greenwald said the revenues generated from these potential sales should make up for the $50 million the city has already sunk into the 4601 Market renovations.The timeline for the police headquarters move is expected to be more or less the same, with the building ready for occupation in the second quarter of 2020.

Point Breeze is a food desertRowhouse Grocery wants to change that,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/24/15680142/rowhouse-grocer-point-breeze-food-desert,article,"When Andrew Dougherty heard about a new venture at 1713 McKean a few months ago from his cousin, the address immediately sounded familiar. After a little digging, it all started coming back to Dougherty: The two-story brick rowhome was the site of his grandfather’s German-American deli during the Great Depression. But for more than 40 years, the corner store that handed out grandpa Edward Dougherty’s famous German potato salad has been abandoned, a sign of blight at the corner of McKean and a dead-ended cobblestone section of Colorado Street. Yet soon, the 1,800-square-foot building will be feeding the neighborhood again, when the much-anticipated Rowhouse Grocery opens at the site in August. For many Point Breeze residents, it will be a welcomed, much-needed addition to the neighborhood, which is notoriously starved for supermarkets and has watched multiple proposals for grocery stores come and go in recent years. “It’s been a food desert, so everyone’s looking forward to [Rowhouse Grocery] with open arms,” says Anna Maria Vona of Carmana Designs, who owns 1713 McKean, the adjacent Abbott’s Alderney Dairy building, and a building in the rear of Colorado Court together with her husband, Carmen. In recent years, Point Breeze has experienced tremendous change, with developers building new homes or rehabbing old properties block by block. Yet in an area that has seen revitalization and rapid gentrification, there is still a shortage of places for locals to buy fresh produce.According to a 2014 study conducted by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, the area surrounding 1713 McKean has low to no walkable access to healthy food. No access, for the purposes of the study, is defined as an area without even a corner store within two blocks.“We live equidistant from two different ACME supermarkets, but they’re each about a mile away,” says Allison Hauptman, a Rowhouse Grocery partner who has lived on the 1700 block of McKean for a decade.“Not all of our neighbors have cars,” she continued. “I’ve had neighbors ask me if I’m going and can pick stuff up. I’d really like them to be able to go down the street and get whatever they want.”Hauptman and her boyfriend Travis Weissman, another Rowhouse Grocery partner, had their eyes on the vacant corner store a few doors down from their apartment for years. “I’ve always wondered what’s going on with that building, who owns it,” Hauptman recalls. “The building turned out to be available and [the owners] were so excited about the idea of having a market place to get something to eat in the neighborhood. We found a place before we even had a business plan.”Until recent rehabilitation work replaced part of the masonry and evicted countless pigeons, the building appeared to be a typical derelict rowhouse. It showed no signs of having been a deli, although the restored Abbott's Alderney Dairy building next door provides a clue. According to oral histories from local residents the part-commercial, part-residential building has been used as a fish store, candy shop, children’s clothing store and, once, the storefront creamery for the adjacent dairy.This culinary heritage meshes well with the intentions of Rowhouse Grocery’s four partners, which are to provide affordable fresh produce, meat, pantry staples, and yes, dairy products, to the largely Indonesian, Mexican and African American neighborhood that’s ripe with bodegas, but lacking in grocery stores. Rowhouse Grocery does not aim to be a destination eatery, but rather satisfy the neighborhood residents’ appetite for produce and pantry staples. While there are plenty of bodegas that offer canned goods, “the most important thing to us is that we are carrying products that our neighbors want, and that are affordable to our neighbors,” says Hauptman.Rachel Klein, a resident of the neighborhood and owner of a nearby vegan eatery, Miss Rachel’s Pantry, says Rowhouse Grocery will be a welcome addition to the area. “I think the neighborhood certainly needs it and can sustain it, and am excited for those who don’t travel far to get food to have a new selection nearby. I think we’ll soon see a point where we don’t have to cross Broad for a really rich food scene over here.”At the Newbold Blues Festival in June, the Rowhouse Grocery will be previewing a selection of its offerings, which may include the Dougherty family’s heirloom potato salad recipe, served through the rear pie window once again.

"Market East is the most affordable retail corridor in U.S., report says",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/23/15679842/market-east-retail-rental-rates-cheap,article,"All of the construction work and pedestrian detours up and down Market East have become a part of every day life for Philly folks, but apparently the development boom up and down the corridor hasn’t gone unnoticed on a national level: Market East has just been named the most affordable retail corridor in the U.S. JLL, a real estate and investment management services company, just released its first-ever City Retail report, which revealed the top affordable and most desirable retail corridors in the country. Market East earned the No. 1 spot in affordability, while Walnut Street was touted as Philly’s “existing prime urban corridor.” Of Market East, the report noted: Once home to vacant lots and failed fortress malls, Market East is now attracting large-format retailers looking to tap into the swelling millennial and empty-nester population. Market East’s average asking prime retail rent is $50 [per square foot] with annual rent growth of 25 percent.Compare those numbers to Walnut Street’s more established corridor across Broad, where retail rent averages $150 per square foot with an annual rent growth of 11.1 percent.Of course, as the report notes, Market East is still very much in the development stage, so its numbers won’t stay that low for very long. As its two major projects—East Market and the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia—come online, rent real estate prices will undoubtedly skyrocket. East Market, in particular, has already announced a long list of its anchor tenants for the $600 million redevelopment project that stretches a couple of city blocks. Iron Hill Brewery and Mom’s Organic Market will open their first Center City locations there, and Wawa has signed one of its biggest Philly-based leases, too. "
Walter Smith School in Point Breeze to become apartments,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/23/15679802/smith-school-philadelphia-sold-ori-feibush,article,"After closing its doors in 2013 and its status in limbo for years after that, we now know the fate of the Walter G. Smith School in Point Breeze: It will be converted into apartments and community space. Local developer Ori Feibush of OCF Realty announced yesterday that he has purchased the 64,500-square-foot school located at 19th and Wharton on social media. He wrote, “Our plans will include the conversion of the former school into an apartment building that includes community spaces and additional neighborhood amenities, as well as the construction of a pair of buildings on the rear lot.”It’s been a long road to get to this point. The Gothic-Revival school, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, shuttered in June 2013 along with dozens of other schools throughout the city. About a year later, news emerged that Maryland-based developer Concordia Group had plans to purchase the property and turn it into apartments. But a grassroots neighborhood group called Save Smith School protested the move in October 2016, arguing that Point Breeze was in need of more schools. It seems that the protests were enough to convince Concordia to back out of the deal. Philadeliquency reports that the developer sold the property to Feibush, who acknowledged Save Smith School’s desires to return the school back to its original purpose. Here is his announcement, published in full: I am excited to announce that my partners and I have purchased the shuttered Walter Smith School at 19th & Wharton. Our plans will include the conversion of the former school into an apartment building that includes community spaces and additional neighborhood amenities, as well as the construction of a pair of buildings on the rear lot.I am aware that a small contingent of neighbors would like to see Smith School reopen as a charter school, but it is my opinion that this path would cause irreparable harm to the other public schools in the neighborhood (Childs, Stanton, and McDaniel). I would contend that part of the reason Smith School closed four years ago was because charter schools have taken resources away from neighborhood schools. If Smith were to re-open as a charter school, our other neighborhood schools would close in short order. This is an unintended consequence that pro-charter advocates don't seem to appreciate, but the facts suggest it is a reality.For those who may suggest that Point Breeze needs another school, it is important to point out that when Smith closed four years ago, its students were absorbed by Childs, Stanton, and McDaniel. Since then each school has lost students. Enrollment at Childs has gone from 645 students to 555, Stanton from 306 to 261, and McDaniel from 887 to 603. The two closest schools to Smith, Childs and Stanton, are at 47% and 60% capacity respectively. These schools need enormous help and we should be spending our collective energies fighting to improve them, not to bring back a long since shuttered school.I look forward to presenting plans for the school as they become available.This isn’t the first shuttered school to be converted into apartments. The original West Philadelphia High School has spent the past couple of years undergoing construction and has been turned into loft-style rental units. "
City Fitness latest and largest tenant to join East Market,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/19/15660304/city-fitness-east-market-lease,article,"City Fitness has announced that it has signed a massive lease at the $600 million East Market mixed-use development, just one day after Wawa announced that it would set up shop at 1199 Ludlow Street.At 26,916 square feet, City Fitness is now the biggest retailer to sign onto East Market. City Fitness, a gym chain that started out in Northern Liberties, will take up the entire second floor of the 20-story tower at 1199 Ludlow Street. It will sit above Wawa and Iron Hill Brewery, which will both be on the ground floor of the two-story retail podium of the 240-unit residential tower. The City Fitness will be separate from the fitness center that’s planned just for residents elsewhere in the tower, a spokesperson for East Market clarified. Here’s the full list of tenants who have signed on at East Market so far, broken down by building: "
Philly puts $100M toward citys free home repair assistance program,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/18/15657936/philadelphia-free-home-repair-programs,article,"Now with fresh funding of $100 million, hundreds of Philly homeowners will finally receive free assistance from the city to make their homes more livable. The city announced yesterday that with the new revenue, authorized by City Council last year, it will be able to address its three- to five-year waiting list for its free programs that help with home repairs, long-term disability modifications, and energy efficiency. At yesterday’s announcement, which took place in Olney in front of the first home to be repaired as part of the program, City Council president Darrell Clarke said, “Homes are not islands. We should all care about our neighbors and about making sure every Philadelphian is able to live in a community of choice.”The $100 million comes from last year’s .1 percent hike in the real estate transfer tax. City Council president Darrell Clarke proposed that the revenue raised from the modest increase should go toward funding three Philadelphia Housing Development Corporation (PHDC) programs: The Basic Systems Repair Program (BSRP), Adaptive Modifications Program (AMP), and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).People who live in single-family homes throughout Philadelphia and meet certain household income requirements are eligible for these free programs. But the years-long waiting list means that many of these homeowners have been living in poor conditions. Clarke told Philly Mag’s Property that more than 7,000 backlogged requests have piled up over the past few years. The backlog got so bad that “by the time we got to a request, the owner may have moved because the house was no longer in livable condition.”Since January, the city has been training additional staff to help with the home repairs, which encompass everything from damaged roofs to exposed wiring.

The Beury Building on North Broad is now leasing,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/17/15653164/beury-building-leasing-floor-plans-national-bank-north-philadelphia,article,"After 40 years of abandonment, the return of the iconic Beury building on North Broad is official—now it needs people to fill its space. Developer Shift Capital has announced that it is actively looking for tenants to lease more than 11,000-square-feet of space in the Art Deco behemoth on North Broad and Erie Avenue. It’s the latest development for the much-anticipated rebirth of the Beury building, which dates back to 1926 when it served as the headquarters for the National Bank of North Philadelphia. The 14-story structure was designed by William Harold Lee and was considered an Art Deco masterpiece. But like many other North Broad buildings, the Beury’s state has declined significantly since it was abandoned, left to the same graffiti-laden fate as the Divine Lorraine. Shift Capital’s plans hope to revive the building, and call for 62 one-bedroom units and commercial space built out during the first phase. The second phase includes the construction of an annex, which will add 10,000 square feet of retail, 100,000 square feet of commercial space, and up to 80 residential units. Construction on the first phase of the project is expected to begin at the end of 2017 and be ready for occupancy in spring 2019. There are multiple spaces available for lease on the first, second, and 11th floors. Here are some floor plans and renderings that Shift Capital shared with Curbed Philly. The floor plan reveals that there will be an outdoor terrace on the 11th floor. "
Wawa becomes latest tenant to join massive East Market development,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/16/15646172/wawa-store-east-market-philadelphia,article,"Because Philly can never have enough of them, another Wawa is setting up shop in Center City, this time at the East Market mixed-use development.Wawa and National Real Estate Development announced this morning that the local food market has signed a 6,196-square-foot lease in East Market’s second tower located at 1199 Ludlow Street. The ground-floor store will be located at the corner of 12th and Market, complete with a huge digital hoagie sign above. Wawa’s CEO and president Chris Gheysens said the 6,200-square-foot store will serve as a place to experiment with the company’s newer features that aren’t offered in other locations. He mentioned that the location will have seating, a built-to-order salad line, and a bakery line. There was also talk at the announcement of testing a delivery system for future residents at 1199 Ludlow Street and The Ludlow next door. “We will be doing some delivery tests,” Gheysens suggested. “I can’t imagine why this shouldn’t be the first building where you can go on your Wawa app and have delivery if you live in one of these buildings.” “I can’t promise that,” he added, “but we’ll figure something out.”Wawa is the second tenant to sign onto 1199 Ludlow Street, joining Iron Hill Brewery, which signed a 8,450-square-foot lease at the other corner of the building earlier this year. The upper levels of the 20-story tower will have 240 residential units geared toward young professionals and families. “This stretch of Market Street has great history in retail,” said National Development managing director Daniel Killinger. “We want to bring that active, retail vibrancy back to Market Street but in a very modern, Philadelphia way, and Wawa is a key piece to making that transformation happen.”  Wawa at East Market opens in spring 2018 (“Maybe sooner,” said Gheysens). It’s also announced two other locations at 13th and Chestnut and on South Street. "
"Incredible drone photos capture Comcast Tower, East Market, and more",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/16/15641768/philadelphia-drone-photos-aerial-views,article,"While most of Philly was still in bed, a drone was flying up and around the city Sunday morning, snapping these amazing views of major developments under construction throughout Center City and University City. Christopher Kao is an FAA Part 107 certified commercial drone pilot and flies a DJI Phantom 4 around Philly, offering views of the city that a majority of us would never be able to see under normal circumstances. On Sunday, May 14, Kao rose bright and early at 5 a.m. to take his drone on a ride past the Comcast Technology Center, East Market, 1213 Walnut, and East Market. He shared his images with Curbed Philly (you can download them over at his website Phillybydrone.com, too) to offer a birds’ eye view of these major developments. When we last caught aerial views of the Comcast Technology Center, its core was still in plain view. Not any more! This immense 60-story, 1,121-foot tower designed by Foster + Partners will be home to a Four Seasons Hotel, the new headquarters for the company’s technologists, engineers, software architects, and home to the CEO’s 45th-floor home. Here’s a peek inside the actual tower, too. It broke ground in summer 2014 and is expected to be complete—as the tallest tower in the city—in early 2018. The tallest tower in the Washington Square West neighborhood has been topped out since January of this year, while work continues on building out its 322 luxury units. These drone photos offer close-ups of the 26-story building’s roof deck at the top, which will no doubt offer some pretty incredible views of toward the Delaware River, South Philly, and Center City.Not far from 1213 Walnut, the $600 million East Market development project is well underway. The first apartment and retail tower, 1100 Ludlow, topped out long ago, while the second tower’s two-story, retail podium base is quickly rising. Over in University City, the residential development Vue32 is nearing completion and is currently leasing its apartments. At 16 stories, it’s by no means the tallest tower in West Philly (that honor goes to the FMC Tower), but it still stands out at its location at 32nd and Race streets. "
New bill requires safer pedestrian pathways around Philly construction sites,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/15/15640852/philadelphia-pedestrian-protections-bill-sidewalk-closures,article,"Unless you’ve managed to avoid walking around Center City for the past, oh, five years or so, chances are you’ve noticed there is a lot of construction. There’s so much of it, in fact, that you might’ve been kicked off a sidewalk into a busy street, putting you in the way of fast-moving vehicles. No more. Last week, City Council passed a bill that requires more protection for pedestrians regarding sidewalk closures. Boiled down, the bill requires more effort from those who request permits to close a sidewalk for construction, or whatever reason. The pedestrian safety bill passes! pic.twitter.com/KbkxPqNvX1As PlanPhilly reported last week, some form of this legislation has been around since 2008, when then council member Jim Kenney first proposed the bill. At that time, council decided to just make the pedestrian walkways optional. Council member Helen Gym brought the bill to the table again in December 2016, and this time around it was met with nearly unanimous support. Here’s what the bill now requires, per PlanPhilly: It amends legislation introduced by then-councilman Jim Kenney, which states that the Streets Department cannot give developers permission to close a sidewalk unless they offer a written explanation why a covered walkway for pedestrian safety is “impracticable.”Gym’s bill expands the law to require developers to give a written explanation if they are closing even a portion of the sidewalk and, in situations when a covered walkway is not feasible, asking for the option of a protected walkway instead.What exactly is a protected walkway? The bill defines it as, “A portion of a sidewalk, roadway or street open to pedestrian traffic that is bordered by barriers adequate to protect the safety of pedestrians.”"
43-townhome development planned for Northern Liberties,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/9/15592138/northern-liberties-townhomes-liberty-square-prdc-properties,article,"A local developer has unveiled plans to break ground later this month on a 43-townhome development called Liberty Square in Northern Liberties. PRDC Properties has announced that it is building close to four dozen luxury townhomes at 600 N. 5th Street. The 4-story townhomes will range from 2,700 to 3,100 square feet and hit the market starting at $699,000. Liberty Square is the latest planned project from PRDC Properties, which recently finished up the conversion of the nearby Transatlantic building into a 41-apartment building and the restoration of the historic Lincoln apartment building in Washington Square West. Architect Shimi Zakin of Atrium Design Group is working with the developer again on Liberty Square. A one-story warehouse was demolished to make way for Liberty Square. The walk-up townhomes will be a mix of 3- and 4-bedroom properties, each with 10-foot-tall ceiling and roof terraces. There will also be some community green space within the development. And although each home will have a one- or two-car garage, PRDC Properties said the development was designed with walkability in mind. CEO David Perelman noted its location on N. 5th Street, which means homeowners will be just across the street from the new mixed-use development that will include a Target and Yards Brewing Company. With the groundbreaking set for the end of May, the first set of homes should finish construction in early 2018. The whole project is expected to deliver by late 2019. "
Exclusive: Inside The Yards first Philly coworking space in the Steele building,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/8/15557604/coworking-offices-philadelphia-the-yard-photos,article,"This week marks the grand opening of The Yard, the Brooklyn-based coworking company’s first Philly locale at 11th and Ludlow, plus the return of the historic Steele building to Market East. The Yard has set up shop on the second through fifth floors at the Steele building, transforming what was once a dilapidated, abandoned warehouse into a bright and colorful coworking space, decked out in simple, clean-lined office furniture, and local artwork, and a roof deck. “We started thinking about Philly about two years ago,” the Yard’s co-founder and CEO Morris Levy said. That’s about the time the Yard’s Herald Square location opened, and its proximity to Penn Station had Levy thinking about the growing Philly-New York connection. “We thought it was natural to have a location in Philly, since some Yard members are commuters and they’d be able to utilize both spaces,” Levy said. “We did a lot of walks through the city, and this area just felt like it had all the makings of the neighborhood that we were looking for. It felt homey to us.” The deteriorated state of the building at 21 S. 11th Street didn’t deter Levy from leasing the space. In fact, the CEO said that’s exactly what attracted him to the property. “When we were there, we couldn’t even get into the building,” he said. “It was in a really bad state, but it was beautiful. We were just excited to see what it could be and what its full potential was.” The five-story building dates back to 1912, when it served as headquarters for food service company Horn & Hardart. Designed by William Steele and Sons Co., the building was considered groundbreaking at the time for its use of three materials: Brick, reinforced concrete, and, for the first time ever in the city, polychromatic terra cotta. Those materials, plus other Art Deco and neo-classical architectural details, remain on display in the new Yard offices as accents to the modern offices. As with all of its locations, The Yard worked with in-house architect David Bers for the building’s interior fit-out. “The feeling of the building and its bones play a big part into what the outcome is and what the layout is,” Levy said. “We try to leave that open space feel so you can really feel the architecture. The building is really a driver.”The first floor of the Steele building will be home to local health food chain Honeygrow, while The Yard will take up the remaining levels. On each floor, the elevator opens up to a lounge area, with a kitchenette to the right. Accent walls painted in bright colors like pink and yellow are scattered throughout, where there’s a mix of open desks and private offices with sliding glass doors. Members also have the ability to work from the new, 2,000-square-foot roof deck, which offers rarely-seen views of Market East’s ongoing transformation (The $600 million East Market redevelopment, which will bring its own set of office space to the neighborhood, is the Steele building’s next-door neighbor). The plan is for this space to play host to both public and private events that both members and non-members will be able to rent out.The Yard opening comes in the middle of coworking boom occurring in Philly, with increasingly more national operators like The Yard eyeing the city. In Center City alone, national operators lease 64 percent of the 370,589 square feet of downtown coworking space, and another 80,000 square feet is in the pipeline, according to Center City District’s last count. Levy says the increase of coworking spaces speaks to Philly’s entrepreneurial history; The Yard is another space in the city—and one of the first for the neighborhood—for community collaboration to take place. “Certainly, there’s a tremendous and growing entrepreneurial community here—Philly has always has been an entrepreneur’s city.”“I think that Philly is going to a great city for us. And we’re not just another offering—we always try to be an outlier.” "
$45M restoration of Metropolitan Opera House to begin in June,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/4/15545618/metropolitan-opera-house-philadelphia-construction-timelime,article,"Expect to see some signs of life over at the Metropolitan Opera House come June, when renovations and restorations are expected to begin “in earnest.” The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Live Nation has officially confirmed that it has signed on as the main tenant for the 110,000-square-foot historic theater on North Broad. Curbed Philly first learned about Live Nation’s role in the theater’s $45 million redevelopment in late March, when developer Eric Blumenfeld announced the news at a Philadelphia Historical Commission meeting. Live Nation told the Inquirer that people should expect one to two shows per week, bringing in acts like Mary J. Blige and comedian Louis C.K.The historic theater, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, dates back to 1908 and was run by Oscar Hammerstein I, the grandfather of Oscar Hammerstein II. Over the years it’s served as a movie theater, circus venue, and home to a church congregation. Major construction is expected to begin in June. If all goes to plan, Live Nation should open its doors in late 2018. "
Dranoffs One Riverside condo tower opens on the Schuylkill,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/3/15528416/one-riverside-condo-philadelphia-carl-dranoff-photos,article,"Philly’s Center City skyline officially has a new resident, developer Carl Dranoff’s 22-story condo high-rise One Riverside. The modernist skyscraper, designed by architect Cecil Baker, officially celebrated its grand opening with a ribbon-cutting late Tuesday afternoon. The $98 million project, which took two years of construction, is now the city’s first condo tower in seven years to be built from the ground up.“This site is the poster child for Philly’s transformation,” Dranoff said at the grand opening. As Curbed Philly reported at One Riverside’s topping off in May 2016, Dranoff has owned the site at 25th and Locust in Fitler Square for nearly two decades. At that time in 1986, he first converted an old warehouse next door into Locust Point, followed by Locust on the Park, a luxury apartment building. One Riverside almost became another apartment building, until the economic downturn beginning in 2008 convinced Dranoff to focus on the high-end condo market. Today, the glassy One Riverside tower sits in a coveted spot on the Schuylkill River, with direct access to the Schuylkill River Park and Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk, which opened less than a year before the tower broke ground. With its official opening, 80 percent of One Riverside’s 68 luxury condominiums have been sold. The condos, which are some of the most expensive in the city ranging from $715,000 to $7 million, have attracted buyers from the suburbs who are looking to downsize, as well as eds and meds from University City across the Schuylkill River. Five of the new owners have officially moved into their new digs on the Schuylkill, and the Dranoff team expects the rest of the tenants to be able to move in by August. Now, here’s a look at the model units and the swanky amenities and that they’ll have access to, in 13 photos. One Riverside sits right along the Schuylkill River Trail and has views of Center City and the University of Pennsylvania campus across the river. Nearly every unit in the building has a private terrace. The bi-level penthouse, which is on the market for $7 million, has four terraces. The 60-foot lap pool is located on the second floor amenity level, which also features a fitness center, a board room, a club room with a catering kitchen and baby grand piano, and a suite that owners can rent out for overnight guests. Landscape architect Studio Bryan Hanes designed the One Riverside’s outdoor spaces, which include a private park built on top of the tower’s underground parking garage. There’s also a veranda on the other side of One Riverside with an outdoor grilling kitchen."
"Developers reveal timetable, goals for Osage Pine Project",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/27/15433862/move-bombing-rehab-project-pricing-ajr-endeavors,article,"The redevelopment of 36 homes in Cobbs Creek with ties to the 1985 MOVE bombing is moving forward, but don’t expect big changes anytime soon. The developers, AJR Endeavors, said as much at a Cobbs Creek community meeting Tuesday night, when they shared more details about their plans to rehab the three dozen properties. “We’re in the very beginning stages right now,” realtor and AJR Endeavor principal Rodney Ross told Curbed Philly in an interview after the meeting. But the developers did have an answer for one of the first questions posed to them at the meeting: The rehabbed homes will hit the market in the price range of $175,000 to $200,000. “Over the past couple years, prices here have been slowly rising—there are homes already selling for $150,000,” Ross explained. “Since we are doing such a high volume, and including things like tax abatements and finishes that other homes may not have, we’re shooting for a price point that will be a little higher than that and of fair value.”The city paid the homes’ current owners $125,000 for each property, plus $25,000 in moving expenses. The residents at the meeting seemed to be in agreement with price range, according to Ross.Co-principal Anthony Fullard added, “Our goal is to bring this block and community housing values up to where they should be.”A post shared by Jasiri X (@jasiri_x) on May 13, 2015 at 10:05am PDTThe biggest priority for the developer right now is touring all 36 properties to assess the state of each home. Ross said they were only allowed to tour four homes before submitting an RFP. “Some of them are in more better shape than others, but as long as all of them are in similar shape to what we saw, with no major structural issues, we’ll start moving forward in the six-to-nine-month process to get toward signing the RFP.”After the assessment, AJR Endeavors will offer its first preliminary designs to Cobbs Creek community within 45 days. The total $3.2 million project is expected to take two years. The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (RFP) announced earlier in April that it had picked the proposal submitted by AJR Endeavors to rehab the 36 homes on the 6200 block of Osage and Pine. Of the two proposals that were submitted, the PRA said it picked AJR for its strong track record of working in various Philly communities. AJR Endeavors consists of three principals, all who live in Philly: Construction manager Anthony Fullard, real estate developer Jim Robertson, and realtor Rodney Ross. “In fact, it was Jim grew up in Upper Darby nearby and would always be driving by these properties,” said Ross. “So we started talking about this before RFP was out, and he said, ‘Hey, what’s the city doing about these properties?” A couple of months later, the PRA issued the RFP, requesting proposals from developers to purchase the properties, which have never fully recovered from 1985 when the city dropped a bomb on the site. At the time, one of the homes had served as the headquarters of the black liberation group MOVE. Going forward, the trio plans to have an open, transparent process with the community—it’s the least they can do for a neighborhood that has struggled to move past from the 1985 event, said Fullard. “This is not a normal development for us,” he said. “This is about trying to be a part of restoration of families and a community that really has been left behind.”"
Benjamins Desk coworking community signs on at Studebaker building,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/25/15418952/studebaker-building-north-broad-divine-works-blumenfeld,article,"The historic Studebaker building on North Broad has found another tenant: Benjamin’s Desk has signed a lease to transform more than 17,000 square feet of space in the historic building into a coworking community. The site will be called “Divine Works,” a nod to its neighbor the Divine Lorraine, which is located just a few blocks up North Broad and is also owned by developer Eric Blumenfeld. “Divine Works taps into the great momentum created by the ongoing evolution of the utterly grand Divine Lorraine Hotel,” Blumenfeld said in a statement. The historic Studebaker building at 667 N. Broad Street originally served as a manufacturing plant and showroom for the company namesake. It was later home to Ridge Avenue Men’s Shelter and in more recent years to Steven Starr’s catering company. In 2016, TrustHouse Services Group bought the Starr’s catering group. It will continue leasing space in the Studebaker building, now with Benjamin’s Desk.The goal for Blumenfeld and Benjamin’s Desk co-Founder and co-CEO Anthony Maher is for Divine Works to become a live-work-play set-up, given its proximity to not only the Divine Lorraine, but Blumenfeld’s other residential properties up and down North Broad like the Mural Lofts and Lofts 640. Maher said with all of the development happening along North Broad, his hope is to “co-create an extraordinary atmosphere, unlike any other in the city.”Benjamin’s Desk will spend the next few months renovating its space in the Studebaker building and plans to open later this year. It will be the local coworking company’s eighth location in Philly. "
Heres how to buy vacant property from Philly for $1,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/19/15338834/vacant-land-philadelphia-sale-sold-cheap-how-to,article,"After officially opening for business in 2015, the Philadelphia Land Bank is slowly but surely acquiring the thousands of vacant and tax-delinquent properties scattered throughout in the city. The redevelopment tool has a lofty job: At last count, there were more than 40,000 vacant lots in Philly. What does that mean for you? It means that if you live next to a vacant lot, you could potentially acquire it for as little as $1. Here’s how:Once you buy the property for $1 (give or take), you’ll have to pay closing costs. These could cost $1,000 or more and are based on the entire value of the property, not the reduced amount.

River Walk update: City commission approves zoning extension,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/20/15357758/pmc-river-walk-towers-gensler-zoning-update,article,"It’s been some time since PMC Property Group announced its plans to build two mixed-use residential towers along the Schuylkill River. But about five months later, the project has cleared its latest hurdle: Extending a zoning permit that allows the developer to build the project by-right. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission approved Tuesday a request to reinstate Bill No. 140439, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The bill, which had since expired, allows the maximum height at the site of the project, 23rd and Cherry streets, to be 300 feet. It also allows for above-ground parking. The project, designed by Gensler, calls for two thin, glassy towers on what is currently a parking lot. The two structures will be connected by a covered bridge and feature retail and a long list of amenities. As recently as February, PMC presented its updated plans to the Logan Square Neighborhood Association. According to reported minutes, the community had some concerns about increased traffic along Cherry Street due to retail loading. There was also talk of including better pedestrian connections and increased community access, “perhaps culminating at a raised river over-look open to the public.”With the city commission’s approval, the bill now goes to City Council for final approval. The original hope was for the project to break ground by late spring or summer. "
Developer picked to rehab properties tied to 1985 MOVE bombing,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/18/15341696/osage-pine-redevelopment-ajr-endeavors-philadelphia,article,"The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority has picked a local developer to redevelop 36 properties in West Philly that have ties to the infamous MOVE bombing in 1985.The PRA picked AJR Endeavors, LLC to spearhead the project, stating that the company has “a strong track record” of working in communities in Philadelphia. AJR Endeavors was one of two developers that sent in submissions to the PRA’s request for proposals (RFP) that was issued in December 2016. The RFP called for a sensitive proposal given the tragic history of the site, which includes the 6200 Osage Avenue and 6200 Pine Street in Cobbs Creek. In 1985, the city dropped a bomb on this stretch of homes, one of which served as headquarters to the black liberation group MOVE. More than 30 years later, the neighborhood has never fully recovered. The PRA took ownership of the shoddily rebuilt homes in 2000. AJR Endeavors plans to rehabilitate all 36 homes. The site also qualifies for PRA art program that requires developers to contribute at least 1 percent of the project costs to a public art. It’s still months away from the start of construction, PRA spokesperson Jamila Davis told Curbed Philly. It may take another six to nine months for the proposal to receive a redevelopment agreement and approval approval from the PRA board and City Council. When construction does begin, it is expected to take 18 to 24 months.  "
Target confirmed for Lincoln Square at Broad and Washington,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/12/15274600/target-boutique-store-lincoln-square-center-city,article,"Target has confirmed that it will open another one of its small-format stores in Philly, this time at the Lincoln Square mixed-use development at South Broad and Washington Avenue. No, you’re not experiencing déjà vu. This news comes just one week after the retail giant announced that it had signed on for a 47,000-square-foot store at 6th and Spring Garden in July 2018.The 36,000-square-foot Lincoln Square Target will make it the sixth small-format store in Philadelphia when it opens in October 2018. Metro Commercial Brokers, which has represented Target in all of its Philly deals, said the locations are attractive to the retailer for one big reason: “The six locations are all located in high-traffic, high-density areas of the city where guests can benefit from Target’s small-format stores,” said Steve Niggeman, Metro Commercial’s executive vice president. Plans for the 286,170-square-foot Lincoln Square project were first announced in March 2016, a joint venture between Alterra Property Group and MIS Capital. Kimco Realty recently acquired a 90 percent ownership interest in the development, which will bring 322 apartments, a parking garage, restaurants, and retail to the southwest corner of South Broad and Washington. In addition to Target, there will be a 16,000-square-foot Petsmart. And a historic train shed on the property will be converted into a 32,000-square-foot grocery store. The tenant has not yet been named. Construction is already well underway at 1000 S. Broad Street. "

In early 2016, Brickstone revealed its mixed-use plans for the Hale Building, which had sat vacant for years until the developer bought it for $3.5 million in 2015. The design proposal calls for a glassy front entrance, a roof terrace, and office space. The Hale was designed as an office building by Willis G. Hale in 1887, a few years before he would go onto design the Divine Lorraine on North Broad. At the time it was built, the Hale building received harsh criticism for being “a restless jumble” of a structure and the “monstrosity” of Chestnut Street. But today, the return of the Hale to Chestnut Street is just another part of Brickstone’s plans to transform this long-neglected stretch into a live-work-play hub in Center City. Brickstone’s other mixed-use project brought apartments, a Target, and a Fine Wine and Good Spirits to the 1200 block of Chestnut Street.  Here’s a look at the Hale today. "
"Pennrose, WRT design proposal picked for Chinatown site",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/11/15257596/800-vine-street-pennrose-development-rfp,article,"The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA) has picked the design proposal by Pennrose and WRT Design for a prominent Chinatown site, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The decision comes after a March 7 community meeting that drew hundreds to PRA’s headquarters to listen to two developer’s proposals to redevelop 800-30 Vine Street in Chinatown. Pennrose’s development proposal for the property at 8th and Vine streets calls for four buildings, including one senior housing, one hotel, one apartment building, and an Equal Justice Center, which would house legal services for the community under one roof.It also calls for 30,000 square feet public space throughout the development, to serve as a connection between Chinatown and the rest of the city. Pennrose was just one of two proposals that were submitted when the PRA issued and RFP for the site in September 2016. Parkway Corp. also vied for the project, proposing two condo buildings, senior affordable housing, and a 6,000-square-foot urban farm. (See the full breakdown of both proposals here). PRA executive director Gregory Heller told the Inquirer, “We felt the design of [the Pennrose] proposal was much stronger. The architecture was ambitious and really set the tone for how Philadelphia wants to develop.”The decision isn’t completely final, though. The PRA board has to approve the selection, and then it will go to City Council."
Controversial Manayunk project draws mixed reviews with design committee,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/5/15183460/st-marys-master-plan-manayunk-design-meeting,article,"After listening to several Manayunk residents express their concerns about the redevelopment of a former church campus, the Civic Design Review committee voted yesterday to continue the CDR process for the St. Mary's Master Plan District. The committee voted 3 to 2, although the majority of them agreed that the actual design for the master plan was “sensitive” and a “serious proposal.” The redevelopment at play involves the former campus of St. Mary of the Assumption, which includes a church, rectory, school, and a parking lot on 1.7 acres bound by Carson, Conarroe, and Gay streets and Brewery Alley.The proposal calls for 130,840 square feet of both existing and new structures, with 100 apartments, 34 of which would be located in the church, rectory, and school. The rest of the units would be new construction. Parking for 132 vehicles and 50 bike spaces are also included. The committee acknowledged that the site was complex, given its size, sloped streets, and historic nature. Committee chair Nancy Rogo-Trainer pointed out the positives of the design proposal, commending the designer Campbell Thomas & Co. for creating active elevations along Carson Street, pedestrian walkways, and preserving the site’s current structures, two of which are certified historic. But she added, the design fell flat along Conarroe Street. The committee also said that while the overall design was overall agreeable and sensitive, the added density was an issue. The project, developed by American Living Concepts of Manayunk, was proposed in conjunction with an ordinance introduced by Councilman Curtis Jones Jr. in January that would change the area’s zoning from single-family to multi-family housing.  If the ordinance were to go through, the project could be built by-right. Manayunk residents have been vehemently opposed to the project, citing concerns of added density and lack of parking in a neighborhood that’s already struggling with these issues. In recent years, residents and nearby North Light Community Center have been renting the spots in the parking lot that’s currently on the site. At a three-hour community meeting in March, residents voted 145 to 6 in opposition of the master plan.“I recognize that I live in the city, so I do not expect to park in front of my house,” said Manayunk resident Dana Dabek. But since losing the parking spaces in the church, I’ve sometimes had to park half a mile away from my home.”“It’s just very saturated,” she continued, “and the concern with the design is sheer density.” The proposed development is located a couple of blocks away from the Manayunk train station, but many residents commute outside of Philly to areas that are not accessible via public transportation, Dabek said. “I’m not opposed to transit-oriented development,” she said,” but it’s not appropriate for this site,” Dabek said.With the CDR’s vote to continue the process, the St. Mary’s Master Plan will have to present an updated proposal one more time before moving onto to the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. The CDR is a non-binding advisory board to the PCPC. "
"Apartments, retail planned for historic stable on North Broad",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/4/15163292/631-north-broad-stable-adaptive-reuse-project,article,"A historic stable on North Broad is set to turn into a mixed-use apartment building, with the anticipated opening set for spring 2018. Developer Daniel Greenberg of North Broad Living Management confirmed to Curbed Philly that the adaptive reuse plans for the historic E. Hart Stable are moving forward and will bring 41 apartments and 5,000 square feet of ground retail to 631 N. Broad Street. The foundation and bracing work is complete, said Greenberg, and structural demolition is currently underway.  The update comes a couple of years after Naked Philly first reported on the adaptive reuse project. The plans haven’t changed much, if at all, since then. The Italianate-style 30,000-square-foot E. Hart Stable was built in 1867, but the architect is unknown. It has served as the headquarters for many different businesses over its long history, but most recently was home to Calderwood Gallery. It was sold in 2015 for $2.5 million. As the rendering reveals, Greenberg’s project will build a new seven-story addition to the existing structure with a roof deck. Retail will be located on the first floor, and the 41 apartments will be located on the second through seventh floors, according to an L&I permit. When it opens in spring 2018, the project will join a long list of new developments taking shape along North Broad, from the Studebaker Building down the block to the Hanover North Broad mixed-use project on the other end.

Philly breaks ground on 55 affordable Strawberry Mansion apartments,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/3/15160330/strawberry-mansion-apartments-groundbreaking-affordable,article,"Fifty-five new affordable apartments are coming to the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood next to Fairmount Park. Last Friday the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) broke ground on the $23 million Strawberry Mansion Apartments, which will bring 55 energy-efficient homes to a three-square block area bounded by 33rd Street to the west, Arlington Street to the north, 32nd Street to the east, and Berks Street to the south. The groundbreaking marks the start of final phase of PHA’S development in Strawberry Mansion. Prior to the Strawberry Mansion Apartments, the PHA built two other affordable housing developments, including Oakdale apartments, which opened in 2015 and had more than 400 people apply to live in its 12 available units. In a similar case, an affordable housing project in Kensington recently had more than 600 applications for its 51 rentals. Applications have not yet opened yet for the Strawberry Mansion Apartments. But they will all be leased to families earning 60 percent of the area median income or less. Another 10 percent of the units will be reserved for families earning 20 percent of the area median income or less.At the groundbreaking ceremony, Council President Darrell L. Clarke said, ""A quality home near attractive amenities like Fairmount Park should be a dream that's within reach for every Philadelphian.” .@Darrell_Clarke: Strawberry Mansion's central location makes it very desirable. We need to invest in it and  keep it affordable. pic.twitter.com/MEzTbPxZXGThe units will be a mix of walk-up apartments and townhomes, ranging from one- to four-bedrooms. A number of the homes will also be designed to be ADA compliant and for the hearing and/or visually impaired. They’ll also be energy efficient and will feature Energy Star appliances. The groundbreaking comes at an interesting time for Strawberry Mansion, a neighborhood that’s suffered for years from neglect and high poverty rates. But in recent years, there’s been a renewed investment in the neighborhood, which sits right along Fairmount Park and above Brewerytown. A recent report found that there were 37 building permits for new construction issued in Strawberry Mansion in 2016— a huge increase given the fact that in 2011 just one permit was issued there. When construction on Strawberry Mansion Apartments finishes up, there will be a total of 100 affordable housing units in the neighborhood. "
Target picks Northern Liberties for next small-format store,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/3/15161076/target-store-northern-liberties-alliance-hsp-deal,article,"They just keep comin’: Another Target is opening in Philly, this time in Northern Liberties. Developer Alliance HSP announced today that Target plans to open a 47,000-square-foot store at 6th and Spring Garden in July 2018. It will set up shop alongside the future Yards Brewing Company and the Philadelphia Department of Records and Archives, both of which are expected to move in and open later this year. All three tenants will be part of Alliance’s project called SoNo, which will convert the former Destination Maternity warehouse into a mixed-use development. That adaptive reuse project was announced in 2015.When it opens next year, this location will be Target’s fifth small-format store in Philly, joining Rittenhouse Square, Washington Square West, Roxborough, and the Art Museum, which will open this October. These stores tend to have a mix of all of the usual departments like groceries, clothing, beauty, home decor, but they’re slightly more curated. The news comes fresh on the heels of the announcement that Yards Brewing Company had signed on as a major tenant at SoNo. According to Matt Handel, director of leasing at Alliance HSP, at the end of 2016 they expected that the remainder of available space would be leased by smaller retail and office tenants. “That all changed in early 2017 when we connected with Target,” Handel said in a statement. “Once Target determined that the site worked for them, both sides moved quickly to complete the lease.”"
"Plans for Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House move forward with tenant, new signage",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/28/15087386/philadelphia-metropolitan-opera-house-signage-live-nation,article,"The Philadelphia Historical Commission’s architectural committee today unanimously approved plans to install multiple 1930s-era LED signs on the Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House on North Broad.It was also revealed at the meeting that entertainment operator Live Nation has signed onto the project. There has been no commitment for a restaurant tenant yet. “Right now, our focus is on making Live Nation happy,” said developer and partial owner Eric Blumenfeld. “But while we’re doing the facade, I want to give it some sense of identity.” The design proposal by AOS Architects calls for four illuminated signs to be installed along the North Broad facade, including what the committee called the “football sign” in the center that reads “MET.” Another two, the most prominent of the bunch, will include a three-story sign on the side of the building at North Broad and Poplar, and a large billboard-like sign on top of the building. The designers based their proposal on this historical photo of the building taken in 1937, when it functioned as a movie theater. The Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House at 858 N. Broad Street was built in 1908 by Oscar Hammerstein I, the grandfather of Oscar Hammerstein II. Designed by architect William H. McElfatrick, it sat some 4,000 people and was the largest theater of its kind in the world. But after Hammerstein I fell into debt and sold the property, the theater went on to play many roles, from a movie theater, to a circus venue, a ballroom, and most recently, a church for the Holy Ghost congregation. Although the Holy Ghost vacated the property years ago, it still owns the theater along with Blumenfeld, who last May revealed plans to return it into a world-class concert venue with a $35 million renovation. At the time, the tenant hadn’t been announced, but funder Billy Procida described it as one of the ""nation's biggest concert promoters.""The architectural committee expressed concern about the number of proposed signs along North Broad, given the intensity of LED lighting and that some of them will be fixed and while others will be motion displays. They were particularly critical of the football-shaped sign, especially because it won’t serve as an entrance to the theater; the main entrance will actually be on Poplar Street.Blumenfeld agreed that the sign was his least favorite, but argued that it is the most common one shown in historic photos of the building. “I want to fight for the football,” he said to the committee, “because it’s a long building. It gives it some personality and gives it a center.”In the end, the committee compromised by suggesting the removal of another sign on the North Broad facade that reads “UPCOMING” on the rendering. The football can stay, they said. The committee also suggested that the developer try to restore the building’s parapet if budget allows for it, and that the 10-foot-tall HVAC unit on top of the building be designed to be inconspicuous as possible. With the committee’s approval, the design proposal now goes to the Historical Commission. Also at play for the theater: An application for a $5 million RACP state grant to help fund the theater’s exterior restoration. The project description reads: The building's historic designation will return the Metropolitan Opera house to its once opulent state along North Broad Street. The historic designation of the building, requires significant concrete façade work to bring back historic elements. In addition, the historic designation also requires significant customization work including custom doors, windows and glazing.There are a lot of moving parts with this particular project, said Blumenfeld at the end of the meeting. But, he said, as the restoration of the Divine Lorraine down the street finishes up, all attention will be focused on the theater, which these days goes largely unnoticed by passersby. “Right now, I feel like I’m the only one who walks this block,” he said. “My hope is by the end of next year, people will walk down the street and see that there’s life in that facade.” "
Philadelphia Piers on Delaware River sold to NY developer,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/28/15073916/philadelphia-piers-sold-durst-organization-delaware-river,article,"The impending transformation along the Delaware River continues, with the news that a big-time New York-based developer has bought some prime property on the waterfront. The Durst Organization announced Monday that it purchased Philadelphia Piers for $21.4 million from Brandywine Realty Trust. The 4.3-acre property is a collection of four piers (12, 13-15, 19 and 24) just north of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. This marks the first property acquisition outside of New York for Durst, which is behind several major developments in NYC, including One World Trade Center and One Bryant Park. One of its most recent waterfront projects is the BIG-designed Via 57 West on the High Line.The announcement of the purchase comes on the heels of a number of major projects that have been announced for up and down the Delaware River waterfront, the majority of which Curbed Philly has compiled into this one map. Durst hasn’t expressed any detailed plans for the site, which currently houses retail and restaurants, including Dave and Buster’s, Morgan’s Pier, Hibachi Japanese Steakhouse, and the Philadelphia Marine Center marina. But the developer told the Inquirer that it is considering an apartment complex down the road. Still, any signs of new development will be a long ways away. The statement reads: “The Durst Organization sees this site as a long-term hold with significant potential, but has no immediate plans for development.”"
First Brewers Mill townhome in Brewerytown lists for $425K,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/27/15072350/brewerytown-home-for-sale-brewers-mill,article,"Nine townhomes are currently under construction in the heart of Brewerytown, and the first one has hit the market to the tune of $425,000. Argo Property Group is behind the development dubbed Brewers Mill, which is expected to deliver its first phase of homes by this summer and second by fall 2017. Each three-story townhome clocks in at 2,150 square feet and features four bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and a roof deck. Like the rest of the townhomes, the first townhome will feature energy-efficient appliances, a finished basement, and a bonus room. It will also be integrated for Sonos, Nest, and Alexa systems. Brewers Mill is one of the biggest projects to date for Argo Property Group, which is based in Brewerytown and has a number of smaller residential projects in the neighborhood and Fishtown under its belt. This particular project is located on the 1400 block of 28th Street, on what was once a vacant, grassy lot. “This is all about reducing urban blight through the creation of sustainable, affordable new custom homes,” said listing agent Ryan McManus of AgentPHL.

Massive A.C. Moore store in Center City opens April 11,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/27/15052938/ac-moore-store-philadelphia-preview,article,"A huge A.C. Moore store will open its doors right on Broad and Chestnut on Tuesday, April 11, becoming the first city-based location for the arts and crafts retailer. The 27,000-square-foot store has set up shop on the first two levels of 100 S. Broad Street in the former F.Y.E. store. It will be one of the A.C. Moore’s biggest locations and its only bi-level store in the country. It’s safe to ask: Why would A.C. Moore choose Philly for its first city location? “We recognized a need in the Philadelphia retail space for a supplier of arts, crafts and home décor—all at competitive prices—and are taking advantage of that opportunity with this incredible new location,” said Anthony Piperno, chief marketing and merchandising officer for A.C. Moore, in a statement. No doubt the customer base will cater toward those who study and work along the Avenue of the Arts, like University of the Arts students. This collective group of millennials tends to be the driving force behind Center City’s $1 billion retail boom, according to a December 2016 Center City District report.  Before the opening, Curbed Philly got a sneak peek of the new digs, which will have new, expanded features like a classroom that will host art classes and birthday parties; a kids arts-and-crafts section; and—brace yourselves—its first-ever home decor section. Take a tour below. And heads up: The first 500 customers on opening day will receive a $10 gift card. The rest of opening week will feature daily deals, too. "
Here are the latest renderings of the $3.5B Schuylkill Yards project,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/27/15071252/new-schuylkill-yards-renderings-drexel,article,"It’s been a few months since we last heard anything about Schuylkill Yards, the ambitious $3.5 billion project to reimagine the area around Drexel University as a internationally-renowned innovation hub. But a recently updated website with new renderings and a video provide a clearer picture of what to expect. There’s a new rendering of one of the towers that will be developed by Brandywine Realty Trust, for example, that reveals a glassy, 7-story facade. It’s not clear what tower this will be—there are a total of 6.9 million square feet planned—but last year, the developer said at an Urban Land Institute panel that the Schuylkill Yards’ first built tower would be a 700,000-square-foot property that will serve as a lab and office space. On the website, an interactive map reveals a 627,000-square-foot office tower called 3101 Market East, with an additional 247,000-square-foot space for a hotel. Here are more stats about the project, broken down: Plans for Schuylkill Yards were first revealed with much fanfare in March 2016. The project proposes to build transform West Philadelphia into a leading innovation hub of the region on 14 acres of land. Most recently, in January 2017 the Philadelphia City Planning Commission approved a measure to change the zoning in the Schuylkill Yards area from industrial use to high-density, commercial mixed-use. City Council still has yet to approve this, but if all goes to plan the project could break ground this year. The first goal is to begin work on Drexel Square, an elliptical-shaped public green space in front of the Bulletin Building. "
Photos: Scannapiecos 500 Walnut condo tower tops off,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/23/15036506/500-walnut-condos-topping-off-scannapieco,article,"Two years after breaking ground, developer Tom Scannapieco’s 500 Walnut, which is on track to become the priciest and swankiest condo tower in Philly, officially topped out today. “This represents a moment at which the city is at ease with its past as well as its future,” architect Cecil Baker said at the ceremony, which included everything from a colonial drummers and pipers playing “Yankee Doodle Boy” to a speech by a Thomas Jefferson impersonator. A refresher on the 500 Walnut: It’s one of Scannapieco’s—and the city’s, for that matter—most exclusive, luxurious residential projects to date, with just 35 residences in the entire 26-story building. There are only one or two residences per floor, and a robotic car-parking garage brings resident’s vehicles to them. Even in the earliest stages of the project, 500 Walnut gained attention when rumors surfaced that Beyonce had bought the property’s penthouse. While that ultimately proved to be false, the project continued to turn heads when in June 2016, the sale of its penthouse for $17.85 million became the most expensive residential transaction in the history of Philadelphia. The property was the last-remaining site for development around Independence Mall, and there were plenty of government agencies and community stakeholders who had to be convinced of the project, including the National Parks Service. “500 Walnut came alive with a friendly environment, with community support,” Baker said. “The National Parks Service and all of the government agencies had a large part in creating the shape of this building.” The skinny tower, constructed by Intech, sits on the corner of 5th and Walnut, almost hugging its modern neighbor at 510 Walnut. The angular shape of the building allows it to hide from view when visitors at the Liberty Bell look toward Independence Hall. But residents will have views of the park from a 4,000-square-foot terrace that sits at tree-line level.Scannapieco said of Baker’s design, “Cecil is the number one reason why I took this project on.” Intech’s William Schwartz called it “the most complex concrete super structure built in this city.” Mayor Jim Kenney was also present for the topping off. He commended Scannapieco and Baker for bringing Philly into the “next level of development and design,” but he also used the platform to speak to the city’s tax abatement program, which exempts owners of new construction from paying taxes on the value of the improvements for 10 years.Kenney said that while the future residents of 500 Walnut will only have to pay taxes on their properties prior to the new construction, in the end they will likely be paying income taxes and high transfer taxes. “I know that the one property that sold for 17.8 million [...] will pay something like $528,000 in transfer taxes. That is an unbelievable number.” He then quipped, “After 10 years, I don’t know what in god’s name in real estate taxes will be like here.” Before today’s topping out, 500 Walnut had more than $100 million in sales, with two-thirds of the building currently sold. One of the condos is on the market for $6,959,000, making it one of the priciest homes for sale in the city. Schwartz said that there’s still “ways to go” on the project, but construction should wrap up by the end of summer or early fall. "
Photos: The Royal Theaters demolition is well underway,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/23/15025846/royal-theater-philadelphia-demolition-photos,article,"Walking down the block of 16th and South streets, it’s easy to see that there’s some construction happening at the site of the former Royal Theater. But it requires continuing toward the back of the building to realize that the historic building is currently being demolished—save the facade—to make way for a mixed-use residential project. A recent visit to the site this week revealed what’s left of the Royal Theater on Kater Street, as the wrecking ball makes way for the Royal on South, a 5-story, mixed-use residential development by Robert Roskamp. Demolition began at the end of February and is expected to finish this spring, according to Hidden City Philadelphia. But not all is lost of the Royal Theater, which opened in 1919 at 1524 South Street and was Philadelphia’s first Black-run theater. The South Street facade will be preserved, since the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia holds an easement on that portion of the property. The Art Deco theater was designed by Frank E. Hahn, with William H. Lee leading the theater design. It’s certified historic both nationally and locally, but after shutting down in 1970 the theater sat abandoned for four decades.Multiple developers presented plans for the theater over the years, until Roskamp bought the property in late 2016 and worked out the plan to save the facade with the Historical Commission. The project calls for 50 apartments, retail, and a series of townhouses along Kater Street. Here some photos taken mid-demolition, revealing the last remnants of the Art Deco theater."
Joynture coworking space now open in former Pearl Art & Craft store,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/22/15002800/joynture-coworking-queen-village-pearl-arts-crafts-store,article,"After years of dashed hopes and failed business ventures, the beloved Pearl Art & Craft building on South Street is back for another go-around and has a new look to go with it. Joynture, a New York-based coworking company, has set up shop on the upper levels of the 33,000-square-foot building, while a Kicks USA store has opened its doors on the ground floor. The Pearl Art & Craft Supply store was a neighborhood staple, but closed in 2011. It sat vacant for a few years, until in 2014 when Millennium Dance Studio opened its doors in the space. But despite its goal to transform that block of South Street, the studio closed up shop less than a year after its grand opening. Two years ago, Joynture co-founder Kyle Riggle stumbled upon the building while house-hunting. He called the number on the “For Sale” sign and bought it for $3.4 million. “More than anything, I loved the neighborhood,” said Riggle. “I like what it has to offer. It has artistic history behind it and from a creative makers standpoint—the history of Pearl Art & Craft being there for so long and such a part of the street—bringing creators and makers there now is a natural progression for that type of building.”Philly is no stranger to co-working spaces. By Technical.ly Philly’s last count, there are more than 30 shared office spaces in the city, from multiple Benjamin’s Desk locations to the new WeWork offices in Northern Liberties and Center City. But Joynture will be the first co-working space located on South Street in the Queen Village neighborhood. “I think what sets us apart in Philadelphia is the area where we’re doing it,” said Riggle. “There are a lot of coworking spaces in North Philly and Center City. I think there are a lot of people working from home in this Society Hill-Queen Village-Bella Vista area, and we can help get some of the people out of coffee shops and surrounded by like-minded people who are making and creating.” Joynture has already signed half of the licenses available for coworkers, who will begin moving in on April 1, according to Riggle. The opening of Joynture means a new look for the Pearl Arts & Crafts building on 417 South Street. Construction crews spent the past 11 months transforming the building inside out, mostly notably adding a wall of windows on the upper level and swapping dance studios for 2,300-square-feet of office space. Riggle, who worked with local firm Ambit Architecture on the redesign, said, “I really wanted to get an updated, modern look and feel to the facade. So that’s why we made the changes to the front of the building.”“One of the things I really loved right off the bat [...] was that back staircase. It’s this super-old, grand staircase that runs the building from the basement to the third floor. I was able to keep this giant staircase that really is the center piece to the community space at Joynture.”As for that iconic “Pearl & Arts” metal sign? That will be replaced by a similar, but modernized version that reads “Kicks USA.” “That being said,” said Riggle, “I still have the Pearl Art & Craft sign, if anyone’s interested in it.” "
Dranoffs SLS Hotel & Residences needs $19M more to break ground,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/21/14998458/sls-hotel-philadelphia-dranoff-construction-update,article,"Is this the year that Philly finally sees the groundbreaking of Carl Dranoff’s 45-story SLS International Hotel & Residences? That all depends on the state budget. Dranoff has applied to the Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) for $19 million for his ambitious $240 million hotel and condo project slated for Broad and Spruce in Center City. It’s the second year the project has requested a state grant, after receiving just $1 million of the $20 million requested last year. “In February of 2017, Dranoff Properties reapplied for the $19 million still needed and we await the Commonwealth’s decision,” Dranoff told Curbed Philly in a statement. “If the RACP grant is awarded we will have sufficient funding to move forward with the project and begin construction."" According to the application, the $19 million will go toward the non-residential portion of the project. The hotel will include 152 rooms and 7,000 square feet of food and beverage options. The 90 condos will begin on the 18th floor. The public can weigh in on any of the projects up for RACP grants until March 30, 2017.  But it’s not clear yet when the RACP funding will be announced: The website currently says “TBD.” It’s been four years Dranoff officially announced plans to build the 45-story hotel where Philadelphia International Records once stood. Looks like we’ll just have to wait a bit longer. "

News of the project were revealed when the Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) revealed its latest listing of projects for round 1 of 2017. The North Station District has applied for a $20 million state grant. The collective North Philadelphia District LLC, which includes HFZ Capital Group, Arete Group, Merchant Equity Group, and Amtrak, wants to start off with a $162 million first phase, which would include building two residential buildings on a four-acre site right by the North Philadelphia Station on 2900 North Broad Street.The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that the two structures would include a six-story, 105-unit apartment building and a 21-story tower with 128 apartments and 214,000 square feet of office space. The currently vacant industrial warehouse, known as the Ink Factory building, would also be turned into a start-up and manufacturing workspace. It’s an ambitious project for the neighborhood, which is currently one of the most poverty-stricken areas in Philly. Its current poverty rate is a staggering 45 percent, according to a recent Center City District report. But the North Philadelphia District group thinks the neighborhood’s location—situated just blocks from public transportation and Temple, poises it for success. If the RACP grant is approved, the project will break ground in 2018 and finish construction on the apartment building and factory in the fall of 2019. The office portion would be complete in October 2021. "
Plans for $245M Camden Tower approved for waterfront development,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/17/14957290/camden-waterfront-office-tower-approved,article,"An 18-story office tower is slated to become the tallest building on Camden’s waterfront, with approvals of $245 million worth of tax incentives recently approved by New Jersey’s state Economic Development Authority. The Inquirer reports that three New Jersey companies—Conner Strong & Buckelew, NFI, and The Michaels Organization (TMO)—received approval from the Economic Development Authority at its March 14 meeting to build an 18-story tower to serve as the trio’s headquarters. The application was submitted under the Grow NJ Program, which awards tax credits to businesses that create or retain jobs in the state. The companies first announced in early March that they had submitted their application for what they’re calling the Camden Tower. They expect to bring 869 jobs to Camden.The office tower will be located within the same development as Liberty Property Trust’s $1 billion Camden Waterfront project. Construction has already started on the American Water Works Company’s new headquarters, a five-story, 222,376-square-foot office. It’s expected to open in 2018, while the 18-story tower anticipates an August 2019 opening. The design of the tower also includes a piazza, which is expected to be able to host up to 1,000 people and have views of the Delaware River and Philly skyline.The companies join a long list of other businesses and organizations that have made their way to Camden, lured by the state’s tax incentive program. The Sixers recently opened their new training facility there, and construction on Subaru’s new $118 million campus is nearing completion, too. "
Avenue 30 townhome development in East Kensington breaks ground,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/16/14944628/avenue-30-townhomes-east-kensington-groundbreaking,article,"Work has started on the transformation of a big, vacant lot in East Kensington into a development of 30 townhomes. Two weeks ago, developer RiverWards Group broke ground on Avenue 30, a townhouse development located on the 2600 blocks of Amber and Collins streets at 2649 Amber Street. Clocking in at 37,620 square feet, it’s the largest project to date for the developer, who is behind smaller projects scattered throughout Fishtown, Kensington, and Port Richmond. “Our size of the projects over last 18 months were in the 10- to 18-unit range per project,” said Mo Rushdy, RiverWards Group’s managing partner. There will be a total of five varying floor plans for the townhomes, but all 30 will have the same features, including a roof deck, 1 or two parking spots, 10-year tax abatement, and Smart Home security system. Here’s the main plan for the entire gated community. Construction on the first phase of homes is expected to wrap up in early winter of this year, followed by full completion in December 2018, managing partner Mo Rushdy told Curbed Philly. But the first phase of homes are expected to hit the market this fall, with prices starting at $339,900. Rushdy said that the starting price of the homes means the development is likely attractive to “buyers who want to stay under the $1,500 a month mortgage payment.”Three of the 30 homes have already been sold. This isn’t the only major development project that’s set to transform this block. Right across the street at 2621-67 Frankford Avenue, a 178-unit mixed-use development called Woods Square will replace what’s currently a parking lot. That big-time project cleared the Civic Design Review process in August 2016. Realtor Julie Hankins said, “I'm very excited to see how these 30 homes will help to continue to transform East Kensington.” It will also be the biggest project for Hankins and the Somers Team to date.

Its official: The Oliver H. Bair Funeral home will be demolished,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/13/14906788/oliver-bair-funeral-home-demolition-1911-walnut,article,"After more than a year of will it or won’t it, the historic Oliver H. Bair Funeral Home in Rittenhouse Square will officially be demolished to make way for a 47-story, mixed-use residential tower. PlanPhilly reports that the Philadelphia Historical Commission voted to approve Southern Land Company’s petition for financial hardship at last Friday’s meeting, giving the developer leeway to raze the building due to its deteriorating state. The demolition of the historic building will make way for 1911 Walnut, a 47-story mixed-use residential tower designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz Architecture. Although previous renderings showed that the facade of the funeral home would be preserved, Timothy Downey of Southern Land Co. said that the whole two-story, brick building is beyond repair.“I’ve learned that I need to be a lot more careful what I promise in the future,” said Downey. “I’m going to do that, I’m going to keep my promise. It’s just never-ended, how much more and more it’s costing to save that [the Warwick Apartments].”Two other buildings, Rittenhouse Coffee Shop and the aforementioned Warwick Apartments will be saved from demolition. They will be converted into affordable housing units in partnership with Project Home."
Another Jewelers Row building nabs zoning permit for residential project,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/10/14880342/jewelers-row-740-sansom-zoning-permit-philadelphia,article,"In light of the way the Tolls Brother project on Jewelers Row has gone, another developer has preemptively secured a residential zoning permit for one of its properties on the same street. The zoning permit secured by PRDC Properties allows for 54 residential units to be built into a 6-story addition onto the 6-story Jewelry Trade Center at 740 Sansom Street, which sits on the opposite end of the row from the proposed 29-story tower by Toll Brothers. PRDC Properties acquired the property seven years ago, and its own offices are based there. The company told the Inquirer that while it applied for the zoning permit, it has no intention to start construction on a residential project at the moment. “We consider it our responsibility to protect our tenants and our asset from any agenda-driven limitations that city agencies may seek to impose on Jewelers Row and the surrounding area,"" the company said. “It was incumbent upon us to take preemptive steps to obtain zoning approvals for the kinds of activities we anticipate may be subject to such limitations, irrespective of any present plans to pursue development at this time.”740 Sansom Street dates back to 1931 and is currently home to more than 40 jewelers’ workshops and studios.

Heres how the 2 proposals for 800-30 Vine Street stack up,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/7/14840892/800-vine-street-proposals-parkway-versus-pennrose,article,"At a community meeting last night, two developers presented their proposals for 800-30 Vine Street in Chinatown to a standing-room only crowd and the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA), which owns the property. The PRA began acquiring the parcels in 1966 and finished in 2012 with 140,000 square feet total. In September of 2016, it issued a request for proposals (RFP) for developers to purchase and develop the CMX4-zoned land with a project that would provide “social impact.” Ultimately, Parkway Corporation and Pennrose submitted proposals, presenting two very different visions for the site to hundreds of people who attended last night’s meeting. The PRA noted in their RFP that it’s a complex site, in that much of the parcels cannot be developed because of two rail tunnels and a sewer easement that run beneath the land. Developers also had to take into account that Chinatown in general is largely separated from the rest of the city by the Vine Street Expressway and lacks green space, senior affordable housing, or community gathering space. With that in mind, here’s what Parkway Corp. and Pennrose brought to the table.After each developer’s 30-minute presentations, they answered a half-hour’s worth of what was mostly positive and inquisitive questions and input from the community. Councilman Mark Squilla said the PRA would use the feedback to help pick one of the two proposals and move forward. PRA director Greg Heller said that once the agency selects a proposal, it will be followed by “several months” of working out an agreement that will then need approval from the Board of Directors. The proposal will then seek City Council approval. Editor’s note: A previous version of this article stated that Pennrose’s project proposed 143 parking spaces. It actually includes 180 spaces. We regret the error."
105-year-old East Kensington rectory gets townhome treatment,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/7/14835802/parish-house-homes-for-sale-kensington-adaptive-reuse,article,"There are many major adaptive reuse projects underway around Philly, from train sheds-turned-grocery stores to schools-turned-affordable housing. But there are other adaptive reuse projects of the smaller variety, like this 105-year-old stone rectory in East Kensington that’s about to make its debut as townhomes. Red Oak Development and the Somers Team have spent the past year converting the former Memorial Parish House at 2126 E. Firth Street into five three-story, three-bedroom townhomes, each with private roof decks. Toner Architects took the lead on the project’s design. A post shared by Red Oak Development (@red.oak.development) on Mar 2, 2017 at 11:08am PST“We’ve worked on the Parish House for about a year, painstakingly restoring it,” said Anthony Giacobbe of Red Oak Development. “And we’re using as much as we can from the original church and rectory and putting it back into the project.” The rectory, built in 1912, was once part of the Church of Emmanuel and the Good Shepherd, which was founded in 1868. Red Oak Development originally bought both properties and planned to repurpose the whole parcel. When the church was deemed  structurally unsound, they sold it to another developer, who then demolished it and built six homes on the lot. When the church was torn down, Red Oak Development, which also doubles as a custom fabricator, tried to salvage as much of the wood as possible. “Anything wood-related that was going to be trashed, we kept,” said Giacobbe. Wooden joists and slate from both the church and the rectory are now featured as reclaimed wood accents throughout the homes, from the remade stair treads, to the handrails, to the bathroom vanities. Some of the homes will have some talking pieces that were found during renovations, including a built-in antique safe in one basement and a stone cross an another’s roof deck. Adaptive reuse projects are nothing new for Red Oak Development, which is based in Kensington (“98 percent of our projects right now are in Kensington,” Giacobbe says). But while the Parish House is not the oldest building they’ve worked on, it’s definitely been the most complicated. “It was by far the most complex because we did not want to do cookie-cutter stuff,” said Giacobbe. “We wanted to treat it with respect, with it being a 105-year-old building. It’s definitely been a labor of love.” Although the three inner townhomes are still under construction, the first two corner homes are set to finish up construction and hit the market this spring, with prices starting in the $600,000s, says Giacobbe.

Photos: Inside Brewerytowns Pyramid Electric building,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/6/14829438/photos-pyramid-electric-building-brewerytown-construction,article,"Every Philly neighborhood has had that one eyesore of a building. Along North Broad, it  was the Divine Lorraine Hotel. In Kensington, it was the Orinoka Mills factory. And on the edge of Brewerytown, it’s the Pyramid Electric building. The triangular-shaped behemoth on a hill has sat at 3101 W. Glenwood Avenue since 1922, when it was designed by architect Leroy B. Rothschild as a furniture warehouse for Harry C. Kahn & Sons. When that company closed up shop, Pyramid Electric Supply Company moved in during the 1960s. But as the story goes for so many warehouses in the city, once that company packed its things, the Pyramid Electric building was abandoned and soon became a source of blight for Brewertyown. For the last 15 years, the six-story shell of a structure has  stood tall as one of the first sights one sees when walking or driving into the neighborhood.Fast forward to today: Construction crews are hard at work, on an aggressive timeline to make sure the building is ready for its future tenants to move into the 50 rental units and 5,000-square-feet of ground-floor commercial space by June. MMPartners, fresh off its recently completed adaptive reuse project A.F. Bornot Dye Works, bought the Pyramid Electric building just last June for $1,382,500. The building had languished on the market for years, unable to find a buyer willing to take a chance on what was still considered an “up-and-coming” neighborhood. “I think when they were marketing it, people just still weren’t drinking the so-called ‘Brewerytown Kool-aid,’” said MMPartners co-founder and managing partner David Waxman. “And I’ll be honest: We debated whether or not we wanted it. So I think the the calculus was like, ‘Okay, in five years, if someone else bought this and developed it, would we kick ourselves if we walked by it? And the answer was, ‘Yep.’”The 71,000 square-foot is now the developer’s biggest undertaking yet. But Waxman and co-founder Aaron Smith say they were lucky that, despite sitting abandoned and vacant for nearly two decades, the building was in “pretty good shape” when they broke ground. That’s allowed for the quick construction timeline: About 12 to 14 months from acquisition to full completion, said Smith. “At the end of the day, the windows and the columns really set the units,” said Waxman, who worked with architect Marshall Sabatini and interior designer Shophouse Design for the project. “Usually these old buildings tell you how they want you to lay it out.”On a recent tour of the building, it was clear that the windows in the studio, 1-bedroom, and 2-bedroom units are the standouts. At the time that MMPartners bought the property, the windows were made of fiberglass. Given the historic nature of the property, about $1.3 million in federal and state tax credits went toward replacing every single window with the original glass fit-outs. The adaptive reuse project is unique in that it will preserve some of the graffiti work that’s covered the columns and walls over the past six or so years. The developers walked through the building multiple times with local graffiti artists, who picked out which works were considered significant and worth keeping. “We’re going to keep specific columns and [graffiti] tags so that you have that vibe that this wasn’t always apartments,” said Smith. When the Pyramid Electric building re-opens this summer as Pyramid Lofts, the units will be priced between about $1,000 to $2,000. Smith says the hope is that their efforts to keep the property’s character will serve as a reminder of the building’s 95-year history to future tenants and the neighborhood. “It’s as beautiful as it is rough,” said Smith. “So to keep the aesthetic is really important to us. [...] Everything is going to be kept as it is, but just a little bit brought back to life.” "
6 important takeaways from Mayor Kenneys 2018 budget you should know,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/3/14791182/mayor-kenney-2018-budget-infrastructure-development-housing,article,"In a speech to City Council yesterday, Mayor Jim Kenney laid out his $4.4 billion budget for 2018, highlighting significant changes to the city’s infrastructure, health and human services, and other various government agencies funds. The total budget is an increase from last year’s $4.2 billion. You can view the full budget via the city’s interactive webpage, but here are six important takeaways related to Philly’s infrastructure, development, and housing that you should know about. Reports emerged earlier this week that the mayor planned to propose $90 million to help cap a portion of I-95 between Chestnut and Walnut streets. In his address, Kenney said that the interstate has long been a “barrier to economic development.” Capping this stretch of I-95 with 11 acres of green space will provide Center City with easier access to the waterfront, he said, and is estimated to have a economic return of $1.6 billion over the next 25 years. Soon after Kenney pledged $90 million for the project, the William Penn Foundation committed $15 million and PennDOT said they would provide $100 million. The mayor asked City Council to support just over one million dollars to create 83 units of rapid housing and supportive housing to help address the city’s rising homelessness rates. Rapid rehousing would support families who have become homeless by helping them move quickly out of a shelter into a community setting. Supportive housing is for people who have a mental illness or addiction. These new units would help the city become less reliant on costly shelter beds, the mayor said, and research shows that they have a 90 percent success rate in preventing a return to homelessness. This #PHLbudget proposes a significant investment in reducing homelessness. Our annual Point in Time count found homelessness on the rise. pic.twitter.com/07C6rOj5uVAnother $25 million was proposed to spruce up the city’s commercial corridors. “We’ll work to reinvigorate main streets across the city,” the mayor said in his address. He pointed to efforts that are already underway, including the improvement of the “pedestrian experience” at South Street’s Headhouse Square, lighting up the Market-Frankford corridor, and increasing security cameras within various neighborhoods.The mayor proposed $174 million to repave Philly’s pot-hole-ridden roads. In addition, this will be the first time that the city budget will dedicate “significant funds” to Vision Zero Philadelphia, an effort to make Philly’s streets less deadly. Mayor Kenney said 100 traffic-related deaths occur each year. The funding go toward improving clearly-defined pedestrian routes and “enforcing slower traffic speeds to save lives” over the next five years, Kenney said. Highlighting the fact that 31 mixed-use projects are currently under construction (by our count, 26 of them are high-rises), Kenney’s budget will also invest in the Licenses and Inspections department by increasing staffing, both internally and externally. “L&I will increase demolitions and have highly-qualified on-call engineers to make recommendations,” the mayor said. Mayor Kenney presented an ordinance to the council to get started on the Rebuild program, his $500 million program to revitalize the city’s parks, rec centers, playgrounds, and libraries that is partially funded by the Philly soda tax. The ordinance calls for the council to issue three $100 million bonds, each every two years. "
East Markets second 20-story tower secures $57M construction loan,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/1/14776898/east-market-second-residential-tower-construction-loan,article,"A $57 million construction loan has been secured to begin construction on the second, taller residential tower at East Market. National Real Estate Development announced today that Wells Fargo will finance construction of the 20-story, 240-unit tower. Work on the building’s two-story retail base, which will include Iron Hill Brewery, has already begun at 1199 Ludlow.It’s the second loan that Wells Fargo has provided for the massive $600 million East Market project. It first loaned $38.5 million for the construction of 1100 Ludlow, an office building that will house Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, the Design Center, and Mom’s Organic Market.Designed by Morris Adjimi and BLT Architects, 1199 Ludlow will be slightly different from the first 17-story residential tower, the Ludlow, which topped off late last year and will include 322 units. The second tower will be slightly taller and offer fewer 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom units, allowing more square footage per apartment. Like its counterpart, there will be perks like a fitness center, conference rooms, and outdoor space. But it does have a slightly longer list of amenities: From the sounds of it, the second tower will be geared more toward established professionals, couples, and families, while the Ludlow has been marketed toward millennials. The second tower is expected to begin leasing in summer 2018 and be move-in ready by the fall. "
Post Brothers begin work on 4th and final tower at Presidential City,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/28/14756582/presidential-city-post-brothers-renovations-philippe-maidenberg,article,"Renovations on the fourth and final tower at Presidential City are underway, with developer Post Brothers working with French architect Philippe Maidenberg to design the lobby, lounge, and model apartments. It will be Maidenberg’s first U.S.-based project. The architect’s Paris-based firm focuses on hotel design, often inserting playful and colorful details into his projects. The same can be said of the proposed designs for the Adams, the fourth tower at Presidential City. Maidenberg re-designed the tower’s dated lobby, incorporating modern finishes and furniture with the building’s original details. Like the other three residential towers, the fourth is named after a U.S. president. The original intention of Presidential City’s developer John McShain in 1950 was to build 48 towers that would be named after all of the presidents. He only managed to build the Washington, Madison, Adams, and Jefferson before selling the rest of the land.Post Brothers bought the property on the edge of Philly near Bala Cynwyd in 2012 for $80 million, and began renovations in 2014. They’re finishing up renovations on the third tower, the Jefferson, and will finish up on the Adams by the end of this year. Here’s how the current, dated lobby will look after the renovations. When the $100 million renovation project is completed this year, it will be the largest residential redevelopment project in Philadelphia. There are a total of 1,000 units—ranging from $1,000 to $4,500 a month—in the community that will have been updated."
"4224 Baltimore Avenue site still a pit, 4 years later",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/28/14753432/4224-baltimore-avenue-development-philadelphia-status,article,"On a normal day, the four-way intersection at 43rd Street and Baltimore Avenue is a hub of activity, with Clarkville restaurant and Green Life Cafe on the two north corners and Clark Park to the south. Meanwhile, the fourth corner at 4224 Baltimore Avenue, stands in stark contrast to the others as an overgrown dirt pit. Construction on a 132-unit residential building—a mix of rentals and condos—with ground-floor commercial space should have been well underway by now at this site. The 4224 Baltimore project was first proposed four years ago in 2013, though the design soon underwent some significant changes until it was met with good reviews from the community and Civic Design Review. With zoning permits in hand and the support of the community, the construction timeline called for a summer 2016 groundbreaking.Yet there has been so signs of activity at the site for months. What gives? Spruce Hill Community Association’s zoning chair Barry Grossbach told Curbed Philly in an e-mail, “Our understanding in Spruce Hill is that the project is still on the drawing board and that the property owner is in the process of completing engineering studies and construction drawings.”That was the last update Grossbach received from the owner, New York-based Clarkmore LLC, at the end of 2016. “We are awaiting further word,” Grossbach said. That’s more or less the same answer that’s been floating around since West Philly Local last questioned the project’s status in October. Around the same time that article was published, there was talk that the project was no longer in play.Clarkmore LLC bought the site in 2008 for $3.5 million and subsequently tore down a historic building that previously served as a school and women’s shelter, according to Naked Philly. Although the owner could have built a project here by-right, the developer decided to collaborate with local organization U3 Ventures, which worked with the community to come up with the design proposal over months of meetings. The project’s website has remained quiet, too, after years of regularly posting updates.Clarkmore and U3 Ventures did not respond to requests for comment. We will update this article if and when we learn more. "
Bonuses could make way for a 17-story tower in Spruce Hill,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/27/14750678/4125-chestnut-residential-tower-renderings-spruce-hill-philadelphia,article,"By proposing a number of bonuses, a developer plans to build a 17-story mixed-use tower in Spruce Hill on a site that’s zoned to allow for a building that’s no more than five stories tall.That’s according to a design proposal posted to the Civic Design Review website ahead of its March 7 meeting next week. The 240-unit project, developed by CRP Builders and designed by KCA Design Associates, LLC, is slated for 4125-4136 Chestnut Street, which is currently a Wash ‘n Lube car wash that would be demolished. The 16,213-square-foot site is currently zoned CMX-4, which allows for a building less or equal to five stories with one or more dwelling units. A series of FAR bonuses would allow for the proposed building to be more than three times that height. Per the design proposal, these are the bonuses: That comes out to a total gross floor area bonus of 186,458.81 square feet, according to the document. The affordable housing bonus, in particular, was added to the city’s zoning code in 2012. Developers who voluntarily incorporate subsidized units in their projects qualify for height bonuses. The project goes to the Civic Design Review next Tuesday. Update 2/28/16: The design proposal has been removed from next Tuesday’s Civic Design Review agenda. "
Revised Germantown YWCA plans up apartments to 36,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/24/14726420/germantown-ywca-adaptive-reuse-development,article,"There have been very little updates about the historic Germantown YWCA adaptive reuse project since the announcement that the city had picked a developer. But new plans reveal that the residential project will now include “as many as” 36 units over the previously proposed 24. The Philadelphia Inquirer shared some updates about the revised plans, which are still being tweaked by the architect. Ohio- and Pittsburgh-based developer KBK Enterprises were picked for the project in November. But a resident expressed concern to the Inquirer that there’s been a bit of radio silence since the announcement: “They announced in November that KBK was renovating, and we haven’t heard anything since. [...] We haven’t even seen drawings, any images. … I find it strange, three or four months later and we don’t know what’s going to happen.”In the November announcement, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA) Board of Directors said KBK Enterprises’ proposal called for 12 1-bedroom and 12 2-bedroom apartments, half of which would be affordable and the rest leased at market rate. Shops and community office spaces on the ground floor are still part of the plan, too. When this project does move along—it was originally slated to debut in summer 2019—it’ll be a welcome change to the Germantown neighborhood. The historic building has sat abandoned for years, victim to fires and decay before the PRA issued an RFP for its redevelopment. "
21 apartments planned for Furness-designed church in Squirrel Hill,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/23/14703666/frank-furness-church-apartment-conversion,article,"The last remaining space in a Frank Furness-designed church in West Philly will be converted into loft apartments. Yesterday the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) approved a change of use variance to convert the former church at 4700 Kingsessing Avenue into 21 market-rate apartments. The 25,600-square-foot property is zoned RTA-1, which allows for the accommodation of two-family, semidetached houses on individual lots. The apartment conversion is the latest and final phase of the adaptive reuse project of the former Church of the Atonement. It was saved from demolition in 2014 after developer Guy Laren of Constellar Corporation and Aaron Wunsch, an assistant professor of historic preservation at University of Pennsylvania, worked to stabilize the structure. The church was designed by Furness and built in 1900, but had fallen into such disrepair that L&I condemned it. Two daycares and one print shop have since leased out spaces in part of the church and the parish building. Architect Thomas Nickel of Atlantes Architects explained during the zoning meeting that the loft units will be built into each bay of the church, with the bedrooms located on the mezzanine level. The apartments will share a wall with one of the two daycares on the property, although there will not be any connection between the two, except for a shared emergency exit. Nickel also considered as little as 20 or as much as 25 units, but found 21 to be the best fit for the available square footage and current framework. “We don’t want to go against the historic fabric of the building,” Nickel said. This isn’t the firm’s first time working on a Frank Furness-designed building. They previously were involved in the renovations of Furness’ Fisher Fine Arts Library at the University of Pennsylvania. Residents of Reinhard Street were represented by lawyer Steve Masters, who expressed concern that parking is not included in the proposed project. The residents have been unhappy with the number of parents who pull in and out of their driveways while picking up children from daycare. Laren’s son, Colin, said that the type of tenants who might rent the units—i.e. single working professionals, Ph.D. students—most likely will not drive cars, given the church’s proximity to public transportation. In past meetings with residents, he also suggested offering decreased monthly rents to tenants without cars.This is a zoning document from 2016 that shows the last current floor plan of both buildings and the unoccupied space in the church that will be converted into apartments. Update: Property owner Colin Laren shared this sample floor plan of the proposed 1-bedroom loft apartments. As for the timeline on the apartment conversion, Laren had this to say in an e-mail: “We are currently finishing the second phase of this project and we hope to get started on the third phase (the apartments) by the end of spring/beginning of summer.”"
NOVO Philly to bring 10 extra-wide townhomes to Logan Square,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/23/14708700/novo-philly-townhomes-logan-square-renderings,article,"The Mormon Temple in Logan Square is about to get some new neighbors across the street: 10 extra-wide luxury townhomes dubbed NOVO Philly. Atrium Design Group and A2Z Development unveiled the project renderings yesterday, revealing 5-story townhomes at 17th and Wood Street that will measure in at 28 feet by 38 feet. The average footprint of a typical Philly townhome is about 20-22 feet wide and 40 feet in depth, according to Shimi Zakin, the principal of Atrium Design Group.“We could build 14 units or a high-rise, but we wanted to come up with a new townhouse idea,” Zakin said. “These will have a very open floor plan, which allows the light from the back and front to travel all the way in.” He added that natural light and open floor plans are two keystones of Atrium and A2Z’s past projects, which include other luxury townhouse developments like 7Inspire in Old City and Laurel Court in Northern Liberties. When it breaks ground in April, NOVO Philly will be a new kind of development for Logan Square, which has mostly experienced a growing interest of high-rise projects within the last year. Two residential towers have been proposed along the Schuylkill River, and another one is poised to break ground this spring at 440 N. 15th Street. Even the Archdiocese of Philadelphia has proposed building two mixed-use high-rises next to the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. Meanwhile, Robert A.M. Stern’s 1601 Vine Street residential tower is currently under construction, also by the Mormon Temple. A two-story building will be demolished to make way for the 10 townhomes. “We didn’t meet with the community because the project was approved by-right,” explained Zakin. “I know that it’s not strictly a single-family townhomes district area, but I believe the community will be happy to see these kind of homes over here—not another huge tower that will block everyone’s views.” Developer Victor Agiv said the neighborhood’s growth made it an easy choice to pick the site. “It’s close to the central business district, and within walking distance to everything you’d need.” The homes, which will start at $2.5 million, will feature a long list of amenities, including three terraces, a hot tub, a three-car garage, and an elevator. Each home, though varying in sizes and floorplans, will include five bedrooms, five full bathrooms, and two half-baths.  After breaking ground in April, Zakin estimates that construction will take two years. The first few units, which should hit the market in the next month or two, will likely be move-in ready by late summer 2018. "
Eastern Tower Community Center still waits to break ground,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/22/14696806/eastern-tower-community-center-groundbreaking,article,"This week we shared various updates on 26 high-rises that are currently under construction or undergoing massive renovations throughout Philly. But one skyscraper was noticeably missing from the list: The Eastern Tower Community Center. The 23-story tower was supposed to break ground before the end of 2016, after the project received $1.3 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) in October. But a recent visit to the site at 1001 Vine Street revealed a nearly full parking lot, and no signs of construction. Sarah Yeung, director of planning for the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation, told Curbed Philly that they had no update on the groundbreaking and that their lawyers are still finalizing the $76 million project’s finances.Meanwhile, a construction permit for the building is still active with Licenses & Inspections, according to public records. The permit calls for a 21-story tower versus 23. The Eastern Tower Community Center at 10th and Vine streets has been floating around since 2008. The current plan is for the center to include 21,000 square feet of office space, 8,700 square feet of retail space, 17,000 square feet of recreation and event space, and 150 residential units. When the project does break ground, construction is estimated to take about one year. Stay tuned."
Whats going on with Temples football stadium plans?,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/22/14687966/temple-football-stadium-feasibility-study-halted,article,"It’s been more than a year since Temple University began a $1.25 million feasibility study for its proposed football stadium, but yesterday a report revealed that the analysis had been put on hold for awhile now. Temple News first reported that the university and architecture firm Moody Nolan haven’t worked on the study for months. But a Temple spokeperson later told the Philadelphia Inquirer that those reports were false, and that there has been “no change in status.” In both reports, Temple confirmed that the university is focusing on its community outreach efforts to try to ensure that the neighborhood is on board with the $130 million football stadium. Plans for the 35,000-seat stadium first emerged last year and drew sharp criticism from both students and neighborhood residents. Despite the opposition, Temple’s Board of Trustees approved the $1.25 million feasibility study in February. A month later, the university announced it had hired AECOM and Moody Nolan to design the campus stadium. The university’s football team currently leases the Eagles stadium in South Philly for $1 million annually. By the sounds of it, it looks like Temple’s home turf won’t change any time soon. "
8 properties in new Callow East neighborhood for sale,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/21/14686114/callow-east-properties-for-sale,article,"Who wants to buy a home when you can purchase an entire neighborhood? A collection of eight properties scattered between Old City and Northern Liberties has hit the market, valued at more than $80 million. Colliers International, who is handling the listing, made the announcement today, dubbing the area for sale as Callow East. “Callow East possesses the ideal footprint to support a modern urban mixed-use development with unobstructed 360 degree city views,” the announcement read.Collectively, the properties amount to 7.75 acres, which makes the development opportunity bigger than the size of Rittenhouse Square, the Philadelphia Inquirer pointed out. Included among the eight properties is a collection of parking lots and 4th and Callowhill Street, which already has design documents in hand for a mixed-use development with multiple high-rises. Designed by Cecil Baker + Partners, the project cleared the Civic Design Review last year. Given its location, it was only a matter of time before the mostly industrial area became a prime development spot. In 2015, the East Callowhill zoning was changed to CMX3, allowing for residential, office, and commercial development and included a bonus building height. The 4th and Callowhill project was designed specifically with the new zoning overlay in mind. Want in? Offers are due by April 7. "
Commission delays decision again on Jewelers Row historic designation,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/10/14579870/jewelers-row-historic-designation-delayed-philadelphia,article,"The Philadelphia Historical Commission voted to delay making a decision on whether or not to designate three properties on Jewelers Row until legal issues regarding their potential demolition become clearer. There were eight votes in favor of tabling the decision and three against the motion.The decision is the latest step in an 6-months-long battle between local preservationists and developer Toll Brothers, whose plans to build a residential high rise on Samson street in place of five buildings on Jewelers Row were made public in August 2016.Opposition against what was a 16-story tower at the time was almost immediate, with an online petition garnering more than 2,500 signatures against the development in three days. The Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia then moved to nominate three of the five buildings for historic designation to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. Designating the buildings as historic would give the Historical Commission jurisdiction over the properties for any future developments. Any proposed changes to the exterior of the buildings to be reviewed and approved by the commission.The nominations for 706-08 Sansom Street and 704 Sansom Street argue that they are historic sites because they have significant character, they are the work of a significant architect (Collins & Autenrieth), and they contribute to the historical heritage of Jewelers Row. The former was original the Publishing House of Henry C. Lea, Co. and the latter was the Electrotype Foundry.The original nominations were considered at the November 19 commission meeting, but the committee voted to delay a decision for another 90 days. Within that timeframe, Toll Brothers released its proposed design for a taller, 29-story tower, revealing a brick facade on the Samson Street and a contemporary, glass facade facing Washington Square Park. At Friday's meeting, opponents of the Toll Bros. development urged the commission to consider the nominations in front of them regardless of the zoning and L&I issues surrounding the project. “Your task is to decide whether or not these buildings meet historical standards,” said Paul Steinke, president of the Preservation Alliance and nominator of the three buildings. “You are not required to pay attention to the legal circus going on around this.” “If you approve the nominations,” he continued, “you will send a signal that as a steward of historic Philadelphia, that Jewelers Row is important and that preserving the facades is important.” Meanwhile, lawyer Carl Primavera testified to the commission that if they were to add the properties to the register, it would cause “millions of dollars” in damages to Toll Brothers and those involved with the project. He added that because the demolition permit has been approved, historic designation of the properties would be “eroding and undercutting the rule of law.” “You can’t hold onto every brick and stick,” he added.The motion to table a decision on historic designation of the properties continues to leave the 29-story condo tower in limbo. Currently, an appeal is pending with the L&I regarding the demolition permits. L&I also said earlier this week that they have requested more information from Toll Brothers and are waiting to take final action. Following that decision, the design proposal will meet with the Civic Design Review, which is an advisory committee. Toll Bros. and SLCE Architects presented the proposal to the CDR earlier this week during an information-only meeting."
L&I weighs in on Toll Brothers air rights argument for 29-story tower,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/8/14551288/jewelers-row-toll-brothers-tower-air-rights,article,"The city’s Licenses and Inspections (L&I) has not accepted Toll Brothers’ unity of use argument to build a 29-story tower on Jewelers Row, a spokesperson clarified to Curbed Philly. “L&I has not accepted Toll’s argument for its 29-story project, as currently proposed as a unified-use as best defined by the Supreme Court,” spokesperson Karen Guss said. “We have requested additional information and are awaiting their response and hopefully at that point we’ll be able to take final action on the application.”The clarification comes after Tuesday’s Civic Design Review meeting, during which the question of air rights was heavily discussed between the committee, members of the public, and Toll Brothers. As Curbed Philly reported, Preservation Alliance’s Paul Steinke inquired how the developer was able to increase the proposed tower’s height from 16 stories to 29. Sixteen stories was the tallest the tower could go, based on the combination of the floor area ratios (FAR) of the five properties purchased on Sansom Street and S. 7th Street. Zoning lawyer Ron Patterson said they had spoken with L&I and had gotten the okay to proceed with the taller project “under the guidance that it was appropriate” via unity of use, which would allow multiple parcels to be considered as one. Guss acknowledged that L&I had told the developers “that we do accept the unity of use concept, even though it’s not in the zoning code. The Supreme Court has recognized it in the state of Pennsylvania, so we recognize it.” “But,” she added, “what we haven’t said is ‘Yes, we are definitely approving this application under that theory.’”L&I is continuing review of the developer’s application. Meanwhile, three of the five properties will be considered for historic designation at Friday’s Philadelphia Historical Commission meeting. "
Jewelers Row tower gets mixed reviews at Civic Design Review,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/7/14539946/jewelers-row-tower-toll-brothers-civic-design-review,article,"During Tuesday afternoon’s Civic Design Review, Toll Brothers’ proposal for the 29-story condo tower on Jewelers Row was met with mixed reviews, with one committee member in full support while others questioned the project’s size and sustainability. Still, the majority of the designers agreed on one thing: The 115-unit tower’s differing facades—glass on the south-facing side and brick on the north facade—need to go. “It should add up to the more than the sum of its parts,” committee chair and architect Nancy Rogo-Trainer said.But in the end, the nearly two-hour discussion between the SLCE Architects, Toll Brothers, and the CDR committee was simply that: A discussion. The presentation was purely informational, since Licenses and Inspections (L&I) is still reviewing the developer’s permit to demolish five structures and build the soaring tower in its spot. L&I already issued a permit for the original plan that called for a 16-story tower. A new permit is needed because the project nearly doubled in height. Here are the main questions and critiques that came out of the informational session. Toll Brothers vice president Brian Emmons listed various reasons why the buildings had to be demolished, including that the differing floor and window elevations did not allow for ADA compliance. “But most importantly, we felt that keeping the facades did not allow us to create a brand new tower that we believe is key to revitalizing this street.” In response, Rogo-Trainer told the developer and designers to come back for the actual Civic Design Review with “a really well-thought out answer to that question while keeping in mind that they’re presenting to designers and architects.”When Toll Bros. first announced its plans to build a residential tower on Jewelers Row, the proposed height was 16 stories, the apparent maximum height that could be built on that 0.42-acre parcel. The question of how air rights were acquired to allow for the increase in height was posed by Preservation Alliance’s Paul Steinke. Lawyer Ron Patterson assured that they were “proceeding under the guidance that it is appropriate.” When architect Cecil Baker prodded them, quipping that it sounded like a case of “alternate facts,” Patterson said that the project would change if they were misguided or proven wrong.  Developer and committee member Leo Addimando said he was a fan of the design proposal and that demolition of the current buildings would not be a loss to the fabric of Philadelphia. But, he added, “This is obviously going to be an imposing structure, so I encourage you to make it even more modern.” That was the general consensus of the committee, which throughout the meeting referred to the tower as having split personalities. The Civic Design Review process now includes a “Sustainability Checklist” that encourages designers to incorporate features like stormwater management, heat island reduction, and bike share stations. Toll Brothers has not said if they are striving for a third-party certification such as LEED, but committee member Dan Garofalo encouraged them to do so, given the size and scope of the project. “The tallest building in the city will be LEED Platinum,” he said of the Comcast Technology Center, “So we know it can be done.” He added, “It would be a positive feature for the building, the city, and you to say that we made an effort to make this a sustainable development.” On Friday, February 10, the Philadelphia Historical Commission will consider nominations for three buildings on Jewelers Row to be added to the Register of Historic Places: 704 and 706-708 Sansom Street. The initial vote was delayed at the November 10, 2016 meeting. When and if L&I issues the permit for the 29-story tower, the design proposal will officially begin the CDR process and the committee will vote whether or not to conclude or continue the reviews for another round.

Former Trump Tower site on Delaware River lists for $12.3M,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/7/14531786/trump-tower-site-pier-philadelphia-for-sale,article,"A 2.13-acre parcel on the Delaware River that was once slated for a tower developed by Donald Trump is now on the market for $12.3 million. Owners Shovels Ready Projects are offering the land at 709-717 North Penn Street, along with plans for a 41-townhouse development called Pier 53 1/2, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. NakedPhilly first reported about the listing back in November 2015, when for sale signs surrounding the property advertised a $12.5 million price tag. The new Inquirer report now includes a smaller price tag and the townhouse development plans. The offer comes more than a decade after Trump first proposed to build Trump Tower, a 45-story condo-hotel on the pier in 2004. That proposal fizzled when the economic recession hit, and eventually Shovels Ready acquired the property in 2015 and have invested $5.5 million. Shovels Ready worked with architecture firm Cecil Baker + Partners on the townhouse development plan, which calls for 2,800-square-foot luxury residences. It’s zoned CMX3 and allows development of up to 400,000 square feet. The developer told the Inquirer that it’s a more practical project for the site than a residential tower. If the future owner of this site goes with the proposed townhouse plan, “the developer of this site will realize a nearly 40 percent return once all 41 town homes are built and sold,” Shovels Ready said in an announcement. It also stated that multiple developers, including some foreign-based, have expressed interest in the property and are putting together bids. The site’s location places it within the Delaware River Waterfront’s proposed master plan for Central Delaware, which is essentially a proposed framework that encourages future development that increases accessibility to the waterfront. The for-sale land on North Penn Street is not defined as one of the plan’s priority sites, but it is located next to one: Festival Pier. That said, while developers aren’t required to adhere to the master plan, whoever eventually buys the triangular-shaped property will likely to be encouraged by the plan’s supporters to take the proposed framework into consideration.

Jumpstart program for aspiring Philly developers eyes expansion ,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/7/14527076/jumpstart-ken-weinstein-expansion-barra-grant,article,"When developer Ken Weinstein began his Jumpstart Germantown program in 2015, part of the reason he did so was to take some responsibilities off his plate. “Jumpstart really started because I saw a need out there,” Weinstein said. “I was receiving more and more inquiries every week from a newbie developer who wanted to meet with me, and it got so overwhelming that I decided to start saying ‘no’ to people.” That’s when Weinstein decided to launch Jumpstart Germantown, a mentoring program for aspiring developers. He developed a sort of crash-course curriculum on all the ins and outs of developing properties in the neighborhood. Meanwhile, his company Philly Office Retail provided mentees with 85 percent financing for the purchase and acquisition of small, vacant or deteriorated properties. The program was so successful that after 18 months, Jumpstart expanded its reach to Kensington and Mt. Airy. To date, 151 mentees have graduated from the program and 22 renovated projects have been completed. And now, with a $125,000 grant from the Barra Foundation and extra help from Philadelphia’s Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), Jumpstart is set to grow even more, both online and throughout the city. “It’s really a game-changer for Jumpstart Germantown, because it will allow us to expand to other neighborhoods—and potentially around the country,” said Weinstein. In order for that to happen, LISC will use a majority of the grant to help Weinstein redesign Jumpstart’s website to make Weinstein’s wealth of knowledge more accessible.“With these projects, you’re not doing something that’s just flipping and then running away,” said LISC’s Andrew Frishkoff. “You’re not doing something that will be ugly and add to blight. We’re hoping that we can help Ken keep that core set of values when we explore other communities.” LISC has helped finance a number of Weinstein’s own projects, so the community development office’s familiarity with his success throughout Germantown and Mount Airy made the partnership an easy choice. The two neighborhoods that Weinstein has his eye on are Mantua in West Philly and Strawberry Mansion, which has experienced an uptick in construction in the last year.While Weinstein says those neighborhood expansions are still in the early stages, a resolution introduced to City Council by Councilman Derek S. Green in December by could draw even more attention to the program at a city-wide level.Frishkoff, who met with the councilman in January to discuss the legislation, says Green sees real estate development and small business growth as linked. The approved legislation means that City Council will have hearings about Jumpstart in May or June. “I think overall that Councilman Green introduced the resolution in order to just help us spread the word and bring together a number of neighborhoods to hear more about the program and how it could benefit each neighborhood,” said Weinstein. After all, word of mouth how Jumpstart Germantown started in the first place. But despite its growth, Frishkoff says the program’s “small-town” roots will always be the key to its success.“A lot of the buildings that Jumpstart developers acquire and renovate are very small scale,” said Frishkoff. “They’ll never be in the public eye, but neighbors will be aware, and community residents will benefit. It’s so important to neighborhood fabric.”"
Iron Hill Brewery latest tenant to join East Market,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/6/14522988/east-market-philadelphia-iron-hill-brewery-restaurant,article,"Iron Hill Brewery has announced that it will set up shop at East Market, becoming the latest tenant to join the massive $600 million dollar mixed-use project at 1150 Market Street. Iron Hill will lease 8,450 square feet of space at East Market, its first location within Philly’s Center City limits and 13th overall. The brewery has hired DC-based firm Street Sense to design the restaurant. The actual brewery will be visible behind the bar and enclosed in glass, according to the announcement. It’ll also have semi-private dining rooms and “breakout rooms” for corporate and convention gatherings. When Iron Hill opens in spring 2018, it will join a long list of other tenants who have already signed onto East Market, including Mom’s Organic Market, the Design Center, and Bohlin Cywinski Jackson at 1100 Ludlow. Construction on the 1st residential tower, the Ludlow, has been underway for the past two years, and second apartment tower will follow. This likely won’t be the last we’ll hear of future East Market tenants, especially as construction forges ahead on the first phase. It’s expected to be complete this spring. "
10-story Hamilton tower in Logan Square to break ground this spring,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/6/14520520/hamilton-tower-project-logan-square-groundbreaking,article,"The first phase of the Hamilton, a residential development planned for a parking lot in Logan Square, is aiming for a May groundbreaking, the developer told Curbed Philly. After sailing through the Civic Design Review process in January, the $130 million, two-phase, by-right project will begin construction at 440 N. 15th Street on the first 10-story residential tower this spring and expects to deliver the apartments by the end of summer 2018. The second phase will include a taller, 16-story tower. “We have a lot of work to do ahead of us, but we have our zoning approvals and everything is in place,” said developer David Yeager. “We’re proceeding with our design development drawings and construction documents, plus making sure we’re staying on budget so that we can commence construction on time.” The first phase is expected to cost $80 million, according to Yeager. The Hamilton is a public-private partnership (P3s) between the Community College of Philadelphia and Radnor Property Group, which was awarded the RFP for the project. The 600 residential units, a mix of efficiency studio, 1-bedroom, and 2-bedroom apartments, will be geared toward international students and young professionals. The site already includes some infrastructure, including an old Philadelphia Inquirer below-grade warehouse, which has allowed for some cost-benefits. The warehouse will be retrofitted into underground parking. In addition, the 10-story tower will use the existing foundation of what’s currently a two-story parking garage. “That structure was built in the 1960s and it’s incredibly well-built,” said Yeager. “So there are some advantages by using the existing foundation systems and piggybacking on that in this overbuild.”Phase 1 will include 280 units and the amenities build-out, which will include a fitness room, library, game room, conference center, a coffee shop, and a courtyard. Yeager explained that in order to stay competitive with the surrounding luxury apartment developments, the Hamilton’s units will be more efficient and smaller in size, while the amenity spaces will be maximized. It’s a trend that Radnor Property Group has noticed in its past P3 projects, which include 3737 Chestnut with Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral and Vue32 with Drexel University. “There continues to be this push for optimizing unit sizes and making them more efficient. So we’ll reduce the size of units, but enhance the quality of the amenity space,” Yeager said. The second phase will follow with a 16-story tower on what’s currently a parking lot, with 320 more units and a community roof deck. The taller tower will enclose the private courtyard. Over the multi-construction phase, Yeager sees the Hamilton bringing some much-needed activity to a large swatch of currently underutilized space in Logan Square. “It’s sort of a contained space if you will, but now with the ability to enliven the sight with a space that’s really going to be activated by, 750 to 850 people—it’s really going to help the connectivity from that part of town into Center City, to Hahnemann Hospital to the Comcast Tower.”"
Rehabbed Orinoka Civic House in Kensington is now leasing,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/3/14487234/orinoka-civic-house-kensington-leasing-information,article,"The story of how Orinoka Mills, a large factory building just a block from Somerset station, went from boom to bust is not an uncommon one for Philadelphia. It goes like this: Textile factory thrives during the city’s “Workshop of the World” era. The industrial boom goes bust. Textile company ships out to the suburbs. The abandoned factory becomes a big source of blight. More specifically, when the Solomon Brothers of Orinoka Mills finally ditched their Kensington headquarters in the 1980s, the factory stood abandoned at Somerset and Ruth streets for nearly 40 years, decaying day by day while earning the reputation of a notorious drug corner and a shooting gallery. “It was an eyesore,” recalled Kevin Gray, New Kensington Community Development Corporations’s real estate development director. “It served as a cover for illicit activity and drugs. It was a really bad spot on the neighborhood and residents were really concerned.”But this is the story of the factory’s second chapter beginning this June, when it reopens as an affordable civic house and attempts to wipe away its four decades of abandonment and neglect. Under its new name the Orinoka Civic House, the adaptive reuse project will feature 51 apartments for low- to moderate-income earners, the new headquarters for NKCDC, and 7,200 square feet of commercial and retail space. The almost-finished $17.8 million project is the result of a long list of partners and funders, including community stakeholders and the Philadelphia Housing Authority, with NKCDC taking the lead. The non-profit organization saw the potential in the building’s redevelopment and what it could do for the neighborhood, which until a few years ago they hadn’t had the manpower to address.  NKCDC covers a huge swath of land around Kensington, stretching from Front Street to the west, Kensington Avenue to the northwest, Frankford Creek to the northeast, and the Delaware River border.“It can be rather difficult to make an impact on an area if you’re too scattered,” explained Gray. “So we put it on ourselves to try to do something with the building after working with city to a acquire it. The idea was to create a catalyst for the neighborhood.” With that goal in mind, NKCDC came up with the idea of turning the factory into a civic house, a space that would encourage civic engagement with the community rather than apart from the community. Says Gray, “It was the idea that Orinoka would be giving people the voice and power to think about their neighborhood and support their neighborhood. That’s the ethos behind it.”In June 2014, NKCDC announced its plans for the building, working with local architecture firm Jibe Design for the rehab of the old factory. They opted for a glass, transparent frontage to encourage both residents and neighbors to engage with the building. In October 2015, the project broke ground and by March 2016 the NKCDC officially became owners of the property, which was transferred from the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development. Today, the affordable housing apartments are nearing the end of construction and now leasing, scheduled to be move-in ready by June 2017. Work on the NKCDC offices and retail on the ground-level will follow soon after. But in order for the concept of the Orinoka Civic House to work, they of course need people to live there. Gray says all potential renters are welcome, but ideally, future tenants would want to be part of and live within a civic-minded community. The same hope goes for the future tenant of the retail and commercial space. Gray says they have been talking to a couple of potential entrepreneurs and local business owners. “We’re confident we’d like to have someone who is community-minded, in tune with the income levels, and able to provide an amenity that won’t already exist at Orinoka.” There is no set rent on the 30 1-bedroom and 21 2-bedroom units, as the prices will be adjusted for household income, which is capped at the 60 percent of the area’s median income. As of right now, the upper income limit for a family of four is $48,180, according to Gray. There are still four months to go until Orinoka Civic House welcomes its new community. But, says Gray, that feels like no time at all considering how long it took to get to this point.The encouraging thing about the project is that its mission, to foster a civic-minded community, has already been put in place to get this project off the ground. “So many people from the city, local residents—everyone made really great effort on many parts,” said Gray. “We’re so thankful.” "
Philly issued 20 percent more new construction permits in 2016,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/26/14400236/philadelphia-new-construction-trends,article,"Last year, Philly experienced a building boom, with more than 1,200 building permits issued for new construction. That’s a 20 percent increase from 2015, and there are no signs of this trend slowing down in 2017, according to a new analysis. FixList, a Philly-based online company that provides real estate data for investment opportunities throughout the city, recently compiled a treasure trove of information about new building and zoning permits issued in Philly from 2011 to 2015. The report’s findings reveal which neighborhoods are slowing down or experiencing a construction boom, as well as what kind of projects are being built. A couple of key details from their findings: No surprise here: A lot of high-rises are under construction in Philly (at least 25 by our last count). FixList found that of the 91 permits that were issued for mixed-use towers (zoned CMX4 and CMX5), 31 are still in play. In fact, five more permits have already been issued in the new year. It’s no surprise that building permits for new construction is on the rise in popular neighborhoods like Fishtown and Kensington. But there are some other neighborhoods where the building boom may not seem so apparent. For example, there were 37 building permits for new construction issued in Strawberry Mansion in 2016—that’s a huge increase given the fact that in 2011 just one permit was issued there. Meanwhile, Northern Liberties, which most recently earned the title as a top Boom Town in the U.S., experienced a lull in new construction in 2016. What kind of projects are being built in Strawberry Mansion, Francisville, and Ludlow (near Kensington)? A whole lot of multi-family rentals—they make up 49 percent of the building permits issued in 2016. You can read peruse the whole report here. "
Toll Bros. reveals Jewelers Row 29-story tower renderings,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/25/14382038/jewelers-row-tower-toll-brothers-renderings,article,"After eight months of heated debate, zoning appeals, and historic nominations, Toll Brothers has finally revealed its design proposal for a soaring condominium tower on Jewelers Row in Washington Square West. The design proposal calls for a 29-story tower with 115 condo units and 2,600 square feet of retail at 702-710 Sansom Street. A total of five buildings will be demolished to make way for the residential building. The developer and designer, New York-based SLCE Architects, presented its design proposal to the Washington Square West Civic Association’s zoning board and local residents Tuesday night, ahead of its scheduled Civic Design Review meeting in early February. The revealed renderings come eight months after Toll Brothers began quietly purchasing properties along Jewelers Row and S. 7th Street in May 2016. When demolition permits were pulled later that year to build what was initially supposed to be a 16-story residential building, it incited a heated debate among the developer, business owners, residents, and local preservationists. The development news garnered so much attention that Mayor Kenney weighed in on the project—twice—pleading with Toll Brothers to release their plans and attempt to save the facades of the buildings.Toll Bros. and SLCE began their presentation highlighting the height of other towers in the neighborhood, including the 45-story, 498-foot-tall St. James on Washington Square. The proposed 29-story tower tops out at about 354 feet and will replace five buildings on Jewelers Row and another on South 7th Street. A majority of the 32 buildings on Jewelers Row range between three and four stories tall. According to Toll Bros. representative Brian Emmons, of five designs the developer presented to community stakeholders over the past few months, they preferred the tallest height most. No shadow studies have been conducted on the proposed tower yet. In an attempt to “knit history, from old to present,” the building is a bit two-faced: The Sansom Street facade would be a mix of brick and metal paneling with factory-style windows. Three to four “modern” storefronts will be at the ground level, next to the condo’s main entrance. While SLCE said the details and materials used are attempts to recall the facades that remain on Jewelers Row, a committee member argued that it was a “little too derivative” of the building next door to the proposed tower.Meanwhile, the northwest facade is essentially a glass rectangle. Zoning committee member and architect Richard Beck suggested that the designers needed to add more depth to this side of the tower. During the public Q&A portion of the meeting, the tower was called an “imposing behemoth” and “a monstrosity.” Paul Steinke of the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia questioned why, after numerous discussions and previous commitments to do so, the facades of the 702-710 Sansom Street structures were not preserved in the proposal. “Many times we looked at preserving the facades,” Emmons said. “But the existing facades just don’t allow support for the base of the tower—it just looks wrong.” For reference, here’s a comparison of Jewelers Row today versus the proposed tower.As the meeting came to a close around 8:30 p.m., the zoning committee met privately to vote whether or not to support the by-right project. They will have a seat at the February 7 Civic Design Review meeting, where Toll Bros. and SLCE will present their proposal again. Depending on the outcome—CDR can ask them to return for a second go—Emmons said they’ll have a more definitive timeline. But construction is expected to take two years, with the first eight to nine months including demolition and building out the core and facade.Meanwhile, the Preservation Alliance, which has been leading the preservation battle against demolition of the current structures, submitted appeals of the demolitions that will be heard next week. Their nominations of 704, 706-08 Sansom Street for historic designation will also be considered at next month’s Historical Commission meeting. "

Developers Goldenberg Group and Hines Development announced that the 26-story tower topped out on January 10, reaching its full height of 285 feet. Now, construction crews are finishing up the facade installation and have moved indoors to begin building up the 322 luxury units. The apartments are expected to begin leasing in April and be move-in ready by July. The website has little information on the individual units, and rental pricing has not been announced. It’s been a little over a year since 1213 Walnut broke ground in December 2015, and the tower has risen quickly concrete pour after concrete pour. When construction finishes up this summer, the tower will feature 7,200 square feet of retail along Walnut and Sansom (next to Fergie’s Pub), and a long list of amenities on the upper levels, including a rooftop deck, elevated dog park, and indoor-outdoor fitness center. It’s also going to be one of the first residential towers of its kind without a parking garage for residents, emphasizing its lean towards tenants who prefer walking or biking. For what it’s worth, there is parking garage next door. "
Affordable housing for artists in West Philly opens January 25,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/24/14369916/4050-haverford-affordable-housing-opening,article,"An affordable housing development geared toward artists in West Philly will officially open Wednesday, January 25 after breaking ground last February. The $7.2 million project, dubbed 4050 Haverford, was designed specifically for artists  in need of affordable live-work spaces. The residential building, designed by PZS Architects, features 20 one-, two-, and three-bedroom units, plus a first-floor community space for the artists and public. The affordable housing project has been 10 years in the making, an effort of People Emergency Center's (PEC) and Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA). The three-story building now stands on formerly vacant lot in West Powelton. After breaking ground in February 2016, calls for applications from artists began in June. Trish Downey of PEC tells Curbed Philly that 300 applications came in on a first-come, first-serve basis. While all 20 leases are not quite “signed and in hand,” Downey says the waiting list is closed and all units are expected to be occupied by March. At the opening ceremony tomorrow at 2 p.m., attendees can help create a map of local neighborhoods and a rope of cloth strands braided together, representing the impact of developments that combine the arts, community, and housing.

That’s according to Brandywine Realty Trust CEO Jeff Sweeney, who told the Philadelphia City Planning Commission that he hopes to begin work on the first projects sometime within the first half of the year, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Drexel and the developer were on hand at a Tuesday meeting for an informational session on the multi-billion dollar project, which was first announced in March 2016. The project proposes to build transform West Philadelphia into a leading innovation hub of the region on 14 acres of land. The commission approved a measure at the meeting to change the zoning in the Schuylkill Yards area from industrial use to high-density, commercial mixed-use. PlanPhilly says two towers have been proposed for the corner of JFK Boulevard and 30th Street, a 783,000-square-foot mixed-use and a 383,000-square-foot residential building.City Council still has to approve the zoning change, but if all goes to plan construction will first begin on the renovation of the Bulletin and the proposed elliptical park.

Watch the Bridge in Old City rise in 5 minutes,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/18/14300314/bridge-old-city-timelapse-video,article,"Just this week we offered readers a sneak peek of the Bridge, a mixed-use residential high-rise at 205 Race Street in Old City. While the whole project has been 15 years in the making, construction took just a little more than a year to go from vacant lot to 17-story tower. Developer Jeffrey Brown explained that construction actually moved along pretty quickly, thanks to the use of a Filigree precast concrete system. Here’s how it works: Slabs of concrete are poured elsewhere, then transported over to the construction site where it’s laid floor by floor and covered by more poured concrete. This process allowed the units to have really smooth, concrete ceilings—and sped up construction of each floor every four days, says Brown. You can see how it all went down in this nearly 5-minute time-lapse construction video of the Bridge from start to finish."

2-tower Hamilton project near North Broad clears Civic Design Review,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/11/14230000/hamilton-tower-project-north-broad-approved,article,"A two-phase, mixed-use development proposed for a parking lot near North Broad has cleared the Civic Design Review hurdle.The design committee members voted unanimously to conclude the CDR process for what’s being called the Hamilton, which was triggered because the proposed project clocks in at more than 100,000 square feet of new space. Altogether, it’s a 500,000-square-foot development. The Hamilton calls for two metal-paneled apartment towers with 600 residential units and 8,000 square feet of retail at 440 N. 15th Street. The site is currently has two structures and a parking lot. It’s owned by the Community College of Philadelphia, so the units will be geared toward the student population. Michael Ytterberg of MY Architecture explained during his presentation that the first phase of construction will include the shorter, 11-story residential tower, the interior garden/amenity area, and 150 parking spaces. The second phase, which will follow “after a couple of years,” will feature the second 16-story residential tower that will be built on the parking lot. During the first phase, the lot will be used for parking and include some landscaping to enliven the space. It’s a bit of an oddly-shaped site, which committee members acknowledged in their review. One aspect that complicates matters is that a portion of the proposed Rail Park cuts through a train shed on the site. The design proposal calls for the train shed to be used for parking, and Ytterberg assured the committee that they’re well aware of the proposed Rail Park plans and will work with the city when and if the times come to construct that portion of the trail. The minimum parking requirement for the site is 150 spaces, so those 19 or so lost from the shed would have to be replaced anywhere within 1,000 feet of the Hamilton.While critiques were kept to a minimum, committee chair Nancy Rogo-Trainer said it was difficult to tell from the current schematic design what the multi-colored, metal paneling will look like. “I would rather you sacrifice variety over quality,” she said to Ytterberg. The conclusion of the CDR process potentially means that the project should progress quickly (as the city allows it) from here on out; it’s currently zoned CMX-4 so it can be built by-right. "

The company also owns Liberties Walk across the street, a four-block stretch of retail. Kushner bought the Piazza from developer Bart Blatstein in 2013. It went through a few years of controversy, and saw a long list of retail and restaurant tenants come and ago, including PYT and King's Oaks. In efforts to rebrand itself and transform its tarnished image, the Piazza re-debuted as the Schmidt’s Commons in June 2016 and welcomed a WeWork into one of its buildings. Kushner’s stepping down means he will be selling some of his assets to attempt to comply with federal ethics laws. It is not clear which specific ones he will sell. "

The project broke ground in February 2016 to much fanfare—it was four years in the making—and has already started pre-leasing its 339 apartments. As planned, the larger building on the southwest corner has progressed more quickly than its neighbor across the street. Window and paneling installations are well underway.

The developer, which has invested $250 million in the neighborhood over the past few years, announced yesterday that Bon Chon, Steve’s Prince of Steaks, Halal Guys, Tea Do, and I-CE NY have signed leases for more than 14,000 square feet of retail space on the ground level of Hamilton Court. The news comes about five months after Post Brothers announced its plans to renovate the historic Hamilton Court, which was originally a swanky hotel-turned-apartment building. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places. But for years, the streetscape along this 39th and Chestnut has been relatively inactive. Michael Pestronk, co-founder of Post Brothers, says they specifically chose to sign on these five restaurants in order to bring some life to the student-friendly neighborhood. In a statement, he said, “They will bring the public back into Hamilton Court, which was long known as one of the city’s most trafficked public venues, but has been a private building for decades.”The goal is for the restaurant tenants to move in by the end of summer 2017, before all of the college students arrive. Meanwhile, apartment renovations are currently underway. Post Brothers says the 1- to 5-bedroom(!) apartments have already been updated, although many of the original details remain: Inlaid wooden floors, ornate fireplaces(!), original beams, and exposed brick walls. They’re also in the process of converting a walled-off parking lot into an outdoor space with bocce courts, fire pits, and lounge areas. All that coupled with the 10,000-square-foot amenity facility that’s being built on the property, which will feature a fitness center, roof terrace with a pool, and yoga room.The apartment renovations and new structure will finish up in a second phase, about two years from now.

A summer groundbreaking may be possible, but nothing has been set in stone, a representative for Southern Land Company told Curbed Philly. The revised plans come after more than a year of tweaks and community input. At one point, the tower was proposed to be as tall as 599 feet, and Southern Land Company attempted to declare financial hardship on Rittenhouse Square Coffee Shop and the Warwick. Now, these two historic properties will be incorporated into the project and provide low-income housing, according to the Inquirer. In addition, the facade of the Oliver Bair Funeral Home will be preserved.Also still in the works is the shorter structure on Sansom Street, which calls for a fitness center on the upper levels and ground-floor retail. The most recent renderings are strikingly similar to those that were accidentally posted to 1911 Walnut’s website in August, then quickly removed. We’re not sure what, if anything, has changed from that design. But here’s how the proposal has changed from January 2016 to today. "

"Peek inside the Willow Street Steam Plant, asbestos and all",https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/20/13981368/willow-steam-plant-philadelphia-photos-interiors,article,"The end of the hulking Willow Street Steam Generation Plant near the future Rail Park may be near. The Inquirer’s architecture critic Inga Saffron reported last week that the two-person group Scolio Turco Inc. has begun the Act 135 process to take conservatorship over the industrial behemoth at 9th and Willow Street, which closed 27 years ago and has become quite the nuisance for the city and residents alike. Joel (also goes by Joe) Palmer of Scolio Turco has experience with Act 135, which allows neighbors to band together to find a court-appointed conservator to take control of blighted properties. Scolio Turco recently unveiled their latest restoration of the Chinese Cultural and Community Center in Chinatown, which used the same state law.The steam plant on Willow Street is currently owned by a Cherry Hill resident, according to Saffron, and has changed hands over the years. There have been requests to demolish the property multiple times, but the remediation efforts—it’s chockfull of asbestos—have proven quite costly. Palmer told Saffron that he thinks the efforts, which are all still in the beginning stages, will cost more than $1 million. Whatever happens, a peek inside reveals just how much the steam plant has fallen into disrepair over the years. Local photographer Matthew Christopher, author of  Abandoned America: Dismantling the Dream shared with Curbed Philly some of the interior photos he took a few years ago. Based on his images, it’s truly in rough shape. “The inside of the building is a toxic mess of asbestos and a multitude of other chemicals,” he wrote on his website. “I didn't have a lot of time, as light was fading fast, and the mostly vertical and very cluttered interior of the building made it hard to find good angles to truly show it off. Nevertheless, the decayed engineering of the site was fascinating and I'm glad that I had the chance to visit it.”"

It’s not the companies’ first time tackling Gallery Mall. Shoemaker spearheaded construction of Gallery I in 1977. Skanska built Gallery II about a decade later. Preliminary construction, namely interior demolition, actually started earlier this year, not a minute after developer PREIT was awarded a $10 million RACP state grant. The total cost of the projection is projected to be around $575 million. Construction will now include a long list of repairs, including replacement of common area floor finishes, ceilings, lightings, and columns, as well as some selective structural demolition. On the exterior, crews will transform the facade, sidewalks, and streetscapes on Market, 11th, 10th, 9th, and Filbert streets. There will be a glass entrance, and a continuous row of ground-level shops and digital signage. If all goes to plan, construction should finish up in August 2018.

Kensington warehouse converted into loft-style apartments,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/16/13982472/south-kensington-warehouse-adaptive-reuse-project,article,"An abandoned warehouse in South Kensington is looking better today than it has in years, thanks to the completion of an adaptive reuse project. Once a rag-turned-cabinet factory, the warehouse at 1737 Howard Street has been converted into a seven loft-style residential units. It’s the result of two local groups, Civetta Property Group and Faithful Holdings, who teamed up to rehab the graffiti-laden property in 2015. The warehouse dates back to the early 1900s when it was a rag factory. We’re told that by the 1960s it became a cabinet-making factory. By 2008, the warehouse was vacant. When Civetta and Faithful Holdings got their hands on the property, they brought on Hybrid Construction to lead the rehab. “[They] brought some amazing design ideas to the table,” says Brennan Tomasetti of Civetta Property Group. The result: A 10,000-square-foot apartment building with a new three-story addition, a bit of extra work rebuilding the second floor, and seven 1- and 2-bedroom apartments with exposed brick and industrial-sized windows. Two of the units have already been leased. The apartments range from $1,450 for this 1-bedroom to $1,995 for a 2-bedroom, 2-bath. Take a look around to see the blighted warehouse’s transformation. "
Historic Washington Square fixer-upper asks $3M,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/12/13919510/washington-square-fixer-upper-for-sale,article,"A historic building in Washington Square that dates back to the mid-1800s is for sale to the tune of $3 million, but the future owner will need to put in a lot more money into the fixer-upper. Bonus if you like Mexican food. The 714 Chestnut Street building is home to El Azteca restaurant on the ground-floor, but the upper three levels are complete blank slates. “They’re three huge shells that I guess you would say are ready to be developed,” says listing agent Marcello Ciurlino. The current owners have been using the top three levels as storage for the store Karl’s Furniture. Today, they’re each 2,500 square feet and feature original architectural details like coifed tin ceilings, large bay windows that look over Chestnut Street, and 10- to -12-foot ceilings. It’s certainly a unique property with a lot of potential. While it could be converted into condos, Ciurlino points out that it’s zoned CMX-5. That allows for as much as 12 stories to be built on top of the structure. The building sits on a block of other 19th-century properties, including a Frank Furness-designed structure-turned-condo across the street. Ciurlino estimates that about 40 percent of the buildings on this block are residential. Recently, the Inquirer’s Inga Saffron lamented that the entire block is zoned for skyscrapers, meaning it could have a similar fate as the nearby Jewelers Row. Still, 714 Chestnut is certified historic, so whatever happens, the facade will be preserved. "
Mayor Kenney: Toll Bros. should reconsider plans for Jewelers Row tower,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/12/13918284/jewelers-row-toll-brothers-mayor-kenney-statement,article,"Last Friday afternoon, Mayor Kenney released his second statement regarding Toll Brothers’ plans to build a condo tower on Jewelers Row, calling their new proposal to double the height “deeply disturbing.” “I had hoped from our previous conversations that they intended to be a good corporate citizen, injecting much needed investment into the area while still respecting its character, but this information calls that into question,” Kenney said. The statement follows the latest news that Toll Brothers plans to build a 29-story condo tower on Jewelers Row, instead of the initially proposed 16-story residential building. In addition, the design proposal, which has yet to be released publicly, does not include preservation of the buildings’ facades. Meanwhile, the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia filed appeals of Toll Brothers’ demolition permits. The appeals for 128 S. 7th Street and 702-10 Sansom Street, were submitted to Licenses & Inspections on Thursday afternoon, Patrick Grossi tells Curbed Philly.The alliance argues, “The L&I failed to follow permit application procedures and enforce posting requirements.” The properties 704 Sansom Street and 706-08 Sansom Street are under consideration for historic designation by the historic commission. Here is Mayor Kenney’s statement, published in full below: The news that Toll Brothers intends to double the height of its Jewelers’ Row project and that they will not maintain the second and third floor facades is deeply disturbing. I had hoped from our previous conversations that they intended to be a good corporate citizen, injecting much needed investment into the area while still respecting its character, but this information calls that into question. While, regrettably, the City, including the Historical Commission, does not have the legal ability to stop the project from moving forward, I am urging Toll Brothers to reconsider these decisions. I expect the Civic Design Review Board to make serious recommendations that will respect the historic nature of the properties, and I urge the Toll Brothers to adopt those recommendations or make the necessary adjustments on their own. If they do not, Toll Brothers will be sending a clear message that they no longer wish to have a productive relationship with the City of Philadelphia."
"Inside the FMC Tower in University City, in photos",https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/8/13882018/fmc-tower-photos-aka-university-city,article,"When the AKA University City suites open in about a month, it will mark the last phase of FMC Tower’s highly-anticipated vertical neighborhood on the edge of the Schuylkill River. “We take delight that the FMC Tower will change the city’s skyline forever,” remarked Gerard Sweeney, CEO and president of Brandywine Realty Trust, whose development company has been at the helm of next-door neighbors Cira Centre and the EVO building. FMC and University of Pennsylvania employees have been moved into the 49-story tower—the tallest in University City—for months now, taking up 622,000 square feet of office space. All that’s really left some final glass panel installations on the west-side of the tower, and the much-touted 28th floor amenity floor, which will feature a skyline terrace, a pool, fitness center, golf simulator, media room, and more. At a recent preview of the FMC Tower, the architects and interior designers involved with the project discussed how they strived to design a so-called vertical neighborhood and a building that served multiple purposes. One thing they knew they needed to include? Multiple lobbies: One for the AKA residences and another for the offices. “That’s why we lifted the hemline of the building,” explains design architect Mark Shoemaker of Pelli Clarke Pelli. but it allows them to co-exist and have individual identities at the same time.” Both lobbies are impressive in their own way. While they both feature warm, slanted wood ceilings, the AKA lobby is accented by a smooth stone welcome desk. Meanwhile, the office’s double-height entrance features views of the Center City skyline across the river. They’re both accessible via a drive-in plaza, which design consultant Edward Asfour of Asfour Gouzy Architects says harkens back to a European piazza. “The lobbies are really an extension of the public space,” he says. “It allows for the private space to open up to the public.” The tower itself is unique in that despite its heavy glass paneling, it’s striving for LEED Silver certification, says BLTa’s Eric Rahe. “It may be the first tower in Philly that’s features both concrete and steel,” Rahe adds. The former is more suitable for residential and steel is ideal for commercial. AKA extended-stay suites, which will take up the upper floors of the tower, revealed varying furnished layouts with gray and black tones, accented by colorful furniture and Flos lighting floor lamps. “Every layout is different,” explained Nicoletti Canesi of Lissoni Architecti. “We wanted to make them different even more, with the colors and furniture so that it feels like everyone can live in different places when they come to stay.” For Larry Korman of AKA + Korman Communities, the new suites will be the first AKA residences have been built from the ground up. Or, “really, from the sky up,” as Korman puts it. Construction of AKA University City should finish up in about a month. Sweeney says in addition to the NYC Michelin-starred Rebel crew’s restaurant, more ground retail tenants will be announced soon. Says Sweeney, “We want to create a sense of place, where nothing really existed before.” "
Modular luxury condo building drops in Graduate Hospital,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/6/13853848/graduate-hospital-bloc23-prefab-condos-for-sale,article,"A modular condo building is currently being dropped pod by pod at 2300 Bainbridge in Graduate Hospital. The project, dubbed Bloc23, broke ground last year and began installing the already constructed condo units last week, Naked Philly reports. In total, the 4-story project, designed by LabHaus, will include 23 high-end condos and underground parking. The condos range from $579,000 for a 2-bedroom, 1-bath unit on the second floor to a $1.449 million 3-bedroom, 3-bath penthouse on the fourth level. It’s taken some time for 55,000-square-foot Bloc23 to get off the ground. The project was first announced around 2011, and it received zoning approval in 2012. By October 2015, nine units had already sold, and a retail tenant—apparently a grocery store—signed on soon after. Developer Stephen Rodriguez tells Curbed Philly that six units are still for sale, and the ground-floor retailer will be announced early next year. The units were constructed off site, and based on photos shared on Bloc23’s Facebook page, the finishes are pretty nice. They’re going to include Kohler fixers, Bertazzoni, Lieber, Bosch and Marvel appliances, floor-to-ceiling windows with retractable shades, and Nest thermostats. Plus, every unit will have access to a roof deck; the penthouses all have private outdoor space. It’s not the only modular building in the works in South Philly. Earlier this summer, a modular apartment building dropped at 12th and Washington. Both of the units in these modular buildings are expected to deliver next year. "
Rendering reveals proposed rooftop pool at Fishtown hotel,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/6/13854394/fishtown-hotel-pool-renderings,article,"Tonight, Fishtown residents will consider plans to build a rooftop pool with an overhang at the proposed hotel on 1220 Frankford Avenue. The pool will be on top of developer Roland Kassis’ proposed boutique hotel. The issue at play is its 6-foot overhang on Leopard Street. Designed by Morris Adjmi Architects, the pool would be atop of the current 5-story brick building at 1220 Frankford Avenue. There will also be some co-working offices on the lower levels. Another structure would be built on the current vacant lot next door. Here’s what the site looks like from Leopard Street. The neighborhood zoning meeting takes place at 7 p.m. at the Fishtown Rec Center. "
Construction begins on $1B Camden Waterfront project,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/6/13853448/camden-waterfront-construction-begins-robert-am-stern,article,"After 15 months of negotiations, Liberty Property Trust has announced that it is ready to immediately begin construction on its $1 billion Camden Waterfront project. First up: Breaking ground on American Water Works Company’s new headquarters, a five-story, 222,376-square-foot office plus an 806-car garage. It’s scheduled to open in 2018 and will aim for LEED Platinum Core and Shell certification. That’s just the beginning of the $1 billion master plan, which was designed by Robert A.M. Stern and first announced in September 2015. In addition to the HQ, the mixed-use development plans for a 180-room Hilton Garden Inn, 188 residential units, and 2.5 more acres of public space on the waterfront. The new renderings released with the announcement reveal two very different looking towers than the original plans. In March, the New Jersey's Economic Development Authority approved the official master plan, but not without a number of revisions. The whole site was reduced by 22 percent. In order to begin development, Liberty Property Trust spent the past year acquiring land and development rights; Dranoff Properties agreed to remove an impeding view easement restriction, for one. Liberty also finalized its Community Investment Agreement with Camden. The developers have agreed to recruit Camden residents for construction jobs, offer local students internships, and incorporate temporary murals to the project. In addition, 20 percent of the residential units will be affordable housing. John Gattuso, Liberty Property Trust regional director, described the future waterfront as “an energetic high performance community.” It will be located just off the Ben Franklin Bridge, so accessible via bike, PATCO, and car.

Toll Brothers double tower height on Jewelers Row,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/6/13853358/jewelers-row-toll-brothers-tower-height-doubled,article,"The rumors are true: Toll Brothers has decided to nearly double the height of its proposed residential tower on Jewelers Row from 16 to 29 stories.Philadelphia Business Journal first reported of the latest development yesterday, which will allow the development company to include 109 condo units. The original plan called for 80 units. It’s the latest move in a months-long battle between the developers and preservationists who oppose the demolition of five buildings on Jewelers Row to make way for the condo tower. In November, the Philadelphia Historical Commission voted to delay its decision on designating two of the five buildings historic. At that meeting, Paul Steinke of the Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia suggested that the plans included a 30-story building. Toll Brothers has yet to make its design proposal public, but it will have to go to the Civic Design Review process next year since its project will now be well over 100,000 square feet. "
ACME Market is coming to Snyder Plaza in South Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/1/13808486/acme-market-at-snyder-plaza-south-philly,article,"ACME Market has signed on to join Snyder Plaza in South Philly, the latest step to enhancing the 30-year-old hub of big box retailers. Developer Goldenberg Group announced that the ACME grocery store will set up shop in the old Shop Rite at 29 Snyder Avenue. After a complete gut and renovations, ACME (plus a Starbucks) is expected to open in summer 2017. The ACME Market should be a welcome addition to the neighborhood, since two other grocers—Superfresh and Pathmark—closed up shop in 2015. Shop Rite then left Snyder Plaza and moved to the old Pathmark location. This won’t be the last we hear about Snyder Plaza, either. In October, Goldenberg Group announced plans to revitalize the shopping center, which is now three decades old. New murals that adorn the big-box stores marked the start of the plaza’s enhancements, and there are plans to incorporate more public spaces and walkways to connect the shopping center to its surrounding neighborhoods.

A representative for Dalian Development said there was no comment at this time. Dalian on the Park was built by Dalian Development and is part of the recently opened $170 million mixed-use development Rodin Square. The apartments sit on top of Whole Foods and features luxury amenities like an infinity pool and lounge area, with views of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The building is currently 30 percent leased, according to CoStar. The price range for the studios, 1-, and 2-bedroom units range from $1,899 to $7,250."
Foster+Partners overwhelming Penn Patient Pavilion clears Civic Design Review,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/30/13791990/norman-foster-penn-patient-pavilion-civic-design-review,article,"The Civic Design Review committee unanimously voted to conclude the design review process for Foster+Partners’ $1.5 billion New Penn Patient Pavilion at the last meeting of the year, but not without warning that the design was relentless and aggressive.“As a citizen of Philadelphia, I find it overwhelming,” architect Cecil Baker said. “Not that contemporary architecture doesn’t belong at Penn, but I’m worried about all this overhang.” “I hope I’m wrong,” he added.The design proposal for the Hospital at University of Pennsylvania’s (HUP) new 500-bed patient center replaces the now-demolished Penn Tower at 1 Convention Avenue. It curves around the Penn Museum, serving as a shiny backdrop, and features multiple pedestrian bridges and a cantilever that runs about 65 feet long. “We want to bring part of Penn’s pedestrian life on the main campus to the medical campus, which is so car-driven,” Foster+Partners’ Chris West said. The New Penn Patient Pavilion is a 1.25 million-square-foot, 13-story project, which triggered the Civic Design Review. The first two levels will be public space, followed by four floors of operating rooms and seven floors of patient rooms. The ends of the building, which West referred to as “lanterns,” will serve as family meeting spaces.Committee chair Nancy Rogo-Trainer added to Baker’s concerns, saying, “I recognize that any large building will be an awkward backdrop to the museum, but it’s going to be a backdrop to a treasure.” “I hope that the view from the museum is more recessive than aggressive,” than it looks like in the renderings, she added. West said that they have been working with Penn Museum from the beginning to ensure that the new building will have no further impact than the original Penn Tower, in terms of shadowing over the museum. The building’s facade will also have more texture and less gold and more bronze-copper hues than what’s expressed in the design proposal, he assured. “We want it to stand on its own but feel like part of the place,” West said, adding that they are aiming for LEED Silver certification, but have “higher goals than that.” With the unanimous vote to conclude the design process, the hospital hopes to break ground by the end of this fall and open in 2021.

40th Street Trolley Portal groundbreaking set for next week,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/29/13774642/40th-street-trolley-portal-groundbreaking-date,article,"University City District will finally break ground on the 40th Street Trolley Portal next week, transforming the concrete-heavy trolley station at 40th Street and Baltimore Avenue into a more welcoming public space with a restaurant. The groundbreaking is set for Tuesday, December 6 at noon. It’s the culmination of years of planning by the University City District, which has been sitting on $2.1 million of raised funds since November 2015. A zoning permit for the project was approved earlier this year in March, the last big push needed to begin construction. The 150-seat restaurant, Trolley Car Station, will be privately managed by developer Ken Weinstein, who is behind Mt. Airy's Trolley Car Diner and East Falls' Trolley Car Cafe. Meanwhile, the public space will be softened with more generous landscaping and vegetation. It’s designed by Andropogon Associates, which also spearheaded the design for Bartram’s Mile, among other local projects. If all goes to plan, the portal should open in next year in September 2017. "
5 things to know about the proposed River Walk project ,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/28/13762610/river-walk-towers-schuylkill-gensler-pmc-information,article,"On November 14, reports emerged that local developer PMC had revised its plans to develop two residential towers at 23rd and Arch streets, which is currently a parking lot and one of the last significant sites along the Schuylkill River.For the River Walk project, PMC is working once again with the global architecture and design firm Gensler, which is also leading the exterior and interior renovations for Aramark’s new headquarters at 2400 Market, also located on the Schuylkill River. The River Walk proposal calls for two 32- and 28-story towers with 600 total units.Gensler principal and design director David Epstein took some time to share more information with Curbed Philly about the revised plans for River Walk, from architectural details to amenities to a groundbreaking date. Here are five big takeaways.“There is more power in your city, more than any in America, for twin buildings,” says Epstein. Instead of designing two “totally different pieces,” Gensler aimed for variety by flipping their position so that the sun hits them in different ways, and the texture of the skins vary, too. “There are subtleties about them, but unity about them as well,” says Epstein. “When the sun hits it over the day, it’s going to be hopefully quite magical and delightful and make it feel different than a lot of these glassy buildings of today.” Epstein says that because the towers are apartment buildings offered at market rate, “it’s really all about every dollar where it counts.” So instead of two fitness centers, two pools, and so forth in both buildings, the amenities will be spread across both, connected with a pedestrian bridge. “It’s a way to force community,” says Epstein. The north tower will feature most of the active amenities, including a pool with aerial views and a fitness center. The south tower will have more of the community spaces, says Epstein. “River Walk is probably going to have a younger group—that’s just how it is in Philadelphia,” says Epstein. “With university students and recent grads, there are a lot of people that I think want a much more social life and we’re hoping the buildings make that happen.” Gensler is currently working on construction documents, and PMC is aiming for a late spring or early summer groundbreaking. A former developer’s zoning permit allows PMC to build by-right, but they’ll have to request an extension since it expires at the end of this year. “That’s still being debated,” says Epstein. “We are drawing it as a single project, but I think the owners are waiting to figure out what the market looks like. But in general, they’re very bullish on the apartment rental market in Philadelphia.” "
New renderings of Chestnut Hills One West condos revealed,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/22/13706686/chestnut-hill-one-west-condos-renderings,article,"It’s been a hot minute since we last checked in on progress at One West, Chestnut Hill’s first major development in two decades. A tour of the condo building in March left much to the imagination, but new renderings offer a preview of what to expect inside the swanky condos. Here’s what we already knew to expect: Lots of outdoor space with views of Germantown Avenue, French doors, and other conservative finishes like hardwood floors and original millwork, in keeping with the Chestnut Hill aesthetic. But the new renderings also reveal subway tiling in the kitchens and bathrooms, private studies, as well as pocket doors. Like in March, five of the 20 units have been sold, and another is under deposit, according to the listing agency Sivel Group. They don’t come cheap: They range in price from $825,000 to $2.5 million. Unit 4G, which recently hit the market for $1.25 million, features two bedrooms, 3.5 baths, and a 346-square-foot terrace. "
New East Market apartment renderings revealed,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/17/13655266/east-market-ludlow-apartments-renderings,article,"It’s full steam ahead at East Market, the $600 million mixed-use project that will span 4.3 acres in Market East. Following Wednesday’s topping off ceremony, new renderings have been revealed of the 17-story tower’s interiors. Dubbed the Ludlow, the residential tower will feature 322 modern apartments with bronze fixtures as accents and nearly floor-to-ceiling windows. According to the newly launched website, there’s a long list of amenities, too: Designed by BLT Architects, the apartment building will share views with another taller residential tower next door that was just approved by the Civic Design Review. That will add on another 240 units to the East Market development, though it’s not clear if or how the units will differ from those in the Ludlow. What we do know is that that the two towers will look slightly different, at least from the outside. BLTa principal Michael Prifti said at yesterday’s topping off ceremony that while both towers and 1100 Ludlow pay homage in some way to the PSFS Building next door, his team intentionally designed three very different buildings. “The idea is that when you’re standing in the middle of East Market, there is no sort of homogenous center,” Prifti said. The 1st phase of East Market is expected to open in late spring 2017, so we’ll be keeping an eye out for when the Ludlow starts leasing. "
Renderings of Foster + Partners Penn Patient Pavilion revealed,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/17/13656876/norman-foster-penn-patient-pavilion-renderings,article,"Five big-time projects have been released ahead of the Civic Design Review on November 29, but one design proposal stands out from the rest: Norman Foster’s curvy and shiny New Patient Pavilion (NPP) for Penn Medicine. The 1,250,000-square-foot structure designed by Foster+Partners certainly makes a statement, based on the many flashy renderings included in the 25-page design proposal. Aluminum is paired with glass to create a tan—if not gold—shimmer both day and night. The $1.5 billion NPP will replace the already-demolished Penn Tower and is set to include 500 inpatient rooms. According to the plans, there will be multiple eating areas, a chapel, and kitchen, and a pedestrian bridge that connects to another campus building. The idea is that the pavilion will serve as the campus hub for the entire Penn Medicine campus. Penn first gave an early, non-official presentation of its plans to the CDR in May, after receiving the OK from the city planning commission. After this official presentation on November 29, the university plans to begin construction by the end of this fall and be ready for occupancy in early 2021.This won’t be the only Foster+Partners project to change the city’s skyline. The firm also designed the 59-story Comcast Innovation and Technology Center, which is currently under construction and will be the city’s first supertall building. "

Dozens of Tutor Perini and Berlin Steel workers and designers involved with the project signed a white steel beam adorned with an American flag and a Christmas tree. They then watched as it was hoisted above and placed on top of the residential tower. The L-shaped building, called the Ludlow, will feature 322 modern residential units, retail, and restaurants. Eventually, it will be joined by another 22-story residential tower next door, also designed by BLT Architects.Meanwhile, next door is 1100 Ludlow, the warehouse-like office building that was designed by Morris Adjmi Architects. In addition to office space, it will include the Design Center, Design Within Reach, and Mom’s Organic Market. The first phase broke ground in October 2014, and posed a difficult challenge for the structural engineers at the Harman Group. “In addition to navigating a challenging urban site, we had to find innovative ways to stack residential, retail and parking layouts across both the podium system and tower system so that it was not only functional, but also beautiful and cost effective,” said senior project engineer Chris Gottschall in a statement. Vertical construction on the first phase didn’t begin until February 2015. With the topping off complete, Ludlow and 1100 Ludlow should open in late spring 2017. "
Zoning board approves St. Laurentius Church apartment plans,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/16/13650308/st-laurentius-church-zoning-approval-fishtown,article,"After delaying a decision for two weeks, the Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) voted yesterday to grant an appeal to convert the historic St. Laurentius Church in Fishtown into apartments. The approval allows Leo Voloshin, owner of PrintFresh studio, to move forward with plans to construct 23 residential units in the city’s first Polish church while preserving the exterior. Voloshin bought the property from the Archdiocese in February and announced plans for the conversion shortly after. Because the 130-year-old property was not zoned for multi-family housing units, it was required to seek variance approval from the city. Before Voloshin purchased the property, residents successfully rallied to save the historic church from demolition. Yet the apartment conversion has still left neighbors at odds, with some concerned with the number of residential units and what the project might mean for parking in the neighborhood. The plan calls for 23 bike spaces and no parking.Voloshin told Fishtown residents at a reportedly heated September zoning meeting that all of the apartments will be one bedrooms, to ensure that only one or two people live in each unit. The future of the church ultimately lay in the hands of the ZBA. At the initial November 1 hearing, the ZBA held off making a decision for two weeks after hearing dozens of neighbors testify against the appeal. The zoning approval on November 15 gives the project the green light to move forward. A call to Voloshin was not returned at the time of publication, but we will update when we know more about the construction timeline. "
Properties tied to 1985 MOVE bombing up for sale,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/16/13649750/move-bombing-homes-for-sale-rfp,article,"The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority is looking for a developer to buy and re-develop three dozen properties in West Philly that have ties to the MOVE bombing in 1985. The redevelopment authority recently issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for 36 properties located along the blocks of 6200 Osage Avenue and 6200 Pine Street in Cobbs Creek, Philly Voice first reported. It will be a particularly sensitive redevelopment project, given the tragic history of the neighborhood. Years of tension and violence between the city and members of MOVE, a local black liberation group, resulted in the infamous MOVE bombing of 1985. On May 13, the city dropped a satchel of explosives onto the rooftop bunker of MOVE’s headquarters at 6221 Osage Avenue, resulting in a widespread fire that destroyed more than 60 homes and left 11 dead. More than 30 years later, residents have had to grapple with the long-lasting effects of the bombing. Although the city attempted to rebuild the properties, it did so hastily and shoddily, and some still sit vacant today. The PRA took ownership of the homes in 2000, and it appears that it seeks a developer who will do a better job. The RFP states: PRA strongly encourages developers to rehabilitate the properties, while not excluding the option of demolition and new construction if that approach proves to be the most viable solution.  Because some of the PRA-owned properties abut owner-occupied units, developers should be prepared to make every effort to address safety issues and prevent work that would adversely affect private properties. The properties are zoned RM-1, which allows for single-, two-, and multi-family unit dwellings. The RFP also suggests that the proposal should be well-designed to improve the overall quality and appearance of the neighborhood, as well as incorporate environmentally-friendly elements. “Developer should also be respectful of the area’s challenged history and the trauma that adjacent residents may have experienced,” the RFP states.The deadline for proposals is December 14, 2016 at 3 p.m."
Legoland Philadelphia seeks Master LEGO Builder,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/15/13636536/legoland-philadelphia-master-builder-job-competition,article,"Who says you need an architecture or engineering degree to build a city? Certainly not LEGOLAND Discover Center Philadelphia, which is looking to hire a full-time master builder. The main job requirement: Must love LEGOs. Okay, there’s a bit more to it. “We want to see someone that’s creative and innovative, someone that interacts well with children and adults, and can be the face of the Discovery Center,” says general manager Michael Taylor.  The 30,000-square-foot center, which is technically located in Plymouth Meeting, just broke ground in October and is expected to open in spring 2017. Just don’t expect the average job application process. First, you have to apply online. Then, applicants will be required to participate in a two-day Brick Factor competition starting Saturday, December 10, where they’ll take part in timed building challenges and be judged by a current master builder and one child. Taylor said they’re still deciding whether there will be any themed challenges. “But more or less, they’ll be able to build what they like,” he says. His advice for potential builders: “Just be creative, be yourself, and do what you do best.” On the last day of the competition, the judges will announce the finalist, whose first big responsibility will be designing and maintaining Miniland Philadelphia, a display of miniaturized Philly landmarks. You can vote for which buildings you want to see here until December 9. After two voting rounds, the winning landmark will be announced in early January. "
Decision on Jewelers Row historic designation delayed,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/11/13597478/decision-on-jewelers-row-historic-designation-delayed,article,"The day after Toll Brothers was given demolition permits for properties on Jewelers Row, the Philadelphia Historical Commission decided to delay its decision on whether two of the buildings at 704 and 706-708 Sansom streets should be designated historic. PlanPhilly reports that testimonies at the Thursday morning meeting were heated, with nearly a dozen property owners on Jewelers Row defending Toll Brothers’ proposal to build a 16-story residential tower. Word on the street, however, is that the tower is actually 30 stories: [Paul Steinke of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia] also said that merchants on the block were being shown renderings of the Toll Brothers project, who report that it would apparently be 30 stories instead of the originally reported 16 stories. The façade on Sansom Street in these renderings would have two storefronts and a central lobby entrance to the condo tower. No preservation of any aspects of the existing storefronts are included.Toll Brothers was issued demolition permits on Wednesday, November 9 to raze the buildings located at 702-710 Sansom Street and another at 128 S. 7th Street to make room for the tower. The developer told the Philadelphia Inquirer that demos are scheduled for mid-2017 and that the project will take two years. The historical commission will revisit the nominations in 90 days. Regardless of the outcome then, city officials have argued that it’s unlikely the designations would protect the properties since Toll Brothers filed demolition permits long before the structures were nominated.

The Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House is now leasing,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/11/13597186/philadelphia-metropolitan-opera-house-leasing,article,"We’ve been waiting for more details on the restoration of the Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House, a hulking abandoned theater on North Broad Street that has certainly seen better days. And while the main tenant has been hush-hush for months, it looks like the owners are actively seeking other tenants to lease out the rest of the enormous 39,2000-square-foot space. Yesterday, just one day after the Divine Lorraine’s iconic signs lit up North Broad again down the street, CBRE put out a call that the Metropolitan Opera House was for lease. According to the brochure, up to 5,600 square feet is available on the ground floor and there’s potential for a 20,000-square-foot roof deck. Developer Eric Blumenfeld, who also owns the Divine Lorraine, the Studebaker Building, and a number of other properties along North Broad, bought the opera house in 2013. Last May, he and funder Billy Procida told potential investors that one of the “nation’s biggest concert promoters” would be the theater’s main tenant. In October, EB Realty’s Chris Cordaro told Curbed Philly that they still couldn’t share any specific details, but that “there’s plenty going on and we’ll be making an exciting announcement formally.” The brochure does state that whoever ends of leasing the rest of the building will be co-tenants with an “entertainment concept” by Avram Hornick and a catering facility by Chef’s Market. Hornick is behind the popular Philly haunts like Morgan’s Pier and Union Transfer. The restoration is expected to cost $35 million, Blumenfeld said in May. Local architecture firm AOS Architects is leading the re-design efforts. #survey view from our private box at the Met #preservation https://t.co/XnoyuSsY0i pic.twitter.com/rOUHanAhzP"

Developer picked for historic Germantown YWCA adaptive reuse project,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/10/13585602/germantown-ywca-adaptive-reuse-development,article,"A developer has been picked to rehabilitate the historic Germantown YWCA building, officials announced yesterday. The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority (PRA) Board of Directors has chosen minority-owned KBK Enterprises to purchase and re-develop the historic building that sits on the edge of Vernon Park at 5820-24 Germantown Avenue. KBK Enterprises, which has offices in Columbus, OH and Pittsburgh, PA, has plans for an adaptive-reuse project that will convert the YWCA into 12 1-bedroom and 12 2-bedroom apartments. Half of the units will be affordable and the other half will be market-rate. In addition to the apartments, the plan calls for commercial and office space on the first floor.  Germantown YWCAA photo posted by Emaleigh Doley (@emaleighsays) on Sep 15, 2015 at 3:14pm PDTThe news comes after the city issued an RFP last July for the rehabilitation project. In selecting the final bid, the PRA considered the project concept and how it would align with the Germantown community, the developer’s track record, and economic opportunity that the project would provide. The historic building dates back to 1915, and served as a safe haven for black and white women in Germantown and became deeply involved with the Civil Rights movement. But in more recent years, the abandoned building had fallen victim to fires and decay and was at risk of demolition due to its state. The development agreement is yet to be finalized, but if City Council approves the proposal, the rehabilitation will be KBK Enterprise’s first Philly-based project. The company has invested $1 billion in real estate across the country is currently part of a $267 million redevelopment project in Detroit that will also include affordable housing. The Germantown YWCA adaptive reuse is expected to be complete in summer 2019. "
"After 40 years, the Divine Lorraines iconic signs shine again",https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/10/13583088/divine-lorraine-sign-lighting-photos,article,"After four decades in the dark, the iconic neon-red signs that sit atop of the Divine Lorraine Hotel have been lit. On Tuesday night, crowds gathered in the rain for a block party at the foot of the historic building on North Broad to watch the signs light up again for the first time in 40 years. In some way, the sign-lighting ceremony served as the one-year anniversary since the start of the Divine Lorraine’s groundbreaking, which took place in September 2015. Under the watch of developer Eric Blumenfeld, the $40 million restoration project will return the once grandiose hotel to its original roots as an apartment building. Anne Fadullon, the city’s Director of the Planning and Development, was there for the celebration, and remarked on the symbolic importance of the project. Hinting toward the presidential election results, she said, “Whatever happens, now, more than ever, this project is all about the community.” Proceeds from the block party benefitted Big Brothers Sisters SEPA, a regular partner with EB Realty projects in Philadelphia. Currently, the lobby restoration is underway and the apartments will be move-in ready by the end of this year. CBRE is currently seeking tenants for a cafe and two restaurants, one of which will be located in the annex building that will be converted into a boutique hotel. The facade of the north-facing side of the Divine Lorraine has been restored, and crews will begin work on the south side, removing graffiti, this week. Billy Procida of Procida Funding & Advisors, provided a $34 million loan for the project. He said despite his New York roots, “This is the best project I’ve ever been a part of.” Did you miss the sign-lighting? Watch our Facebook Live video of the event below.

"Startup Home, a UK-based live-work venture, is coming to Philly",https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/7/13524768/startup-home-coworking-live-work-philadelphia,article,"In a sign of this city’s increasing popularity and burgeoning entrepreneurial community, a UK-based co-working company has announced that it is expanding to the US, choosing Philadelphia as its first base. Startup Home, a UK-based entity that provides co-working and co-living spaces to entrepreneurs and startups, made the announcement last week and plans to break ground in Philly by March 2017. It’ll join a growing list of at least 20 co-working spaces already in the city, but it will be the first to combine co-working and co-living into one. “The first building—we are planning to open between 3 and 5 in Philadelphia alone—will be in an existing building that we will refit for the occasion,” Simone Tarantino, US Executive Director, told Curbed Philly in an e-mail. Depending on how the first building goes, they’ll consider new builds for rest of the properties. One building will be dedicated entirely to women entrepreneurs and another will be home to IoT and Augmented Reality Lab. Tarantino says two developers have already expressed interest in working with them for the new builds. Why Philly? Tarantino points to the city’s young talent pool coming out of Penn, Drexel, and Temple. No definite site has been nailed down, but Startup Home is working with the city and Philly Startup Leaders to pick a location that’s not in Center City. “It will most likely be in a off-centered neighborhood,” says Tarantino. “Think Northern Liberties, Fishtown, South Philly, maybe Spring Garden.”Currently, there are numerous co-working spaces in Center City including WeWork and CultureWorks. Kensington will also be home to smaller live-work spaces at 1222 N. 2nd Street, and what’s been dubbed Techadelphia, a mixed-use development that will feature a tech co-working hub on the ground floor and apartments for rent on the upper levels. At Startup Home, all three or five buildings will feature 20 startups each and 20 “nice-size” bedrooms that are bigger than the average hotel room, says Tarantino. Essentially, the rooms will be big enough for a tenant to live there for the six-month lease, but small enough that he or she is encouraged to spend the most time in the communal, co-working spaces. “The goal is to foster collaboration, network and sharing, key elements of success for entrepreneurs,” says Tarantino. Renderings are not yet available, but Startup Home is working with Mariotti Studio on the design.  "
17-story tower planned for North Broad next to Blue Horizon,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/3/13507850/1324-north-broad-street-tower-renderings,article,"Plans for a 17-story mixed-use tower on North Broad next to the historic Blue Horizon boxing venue are moving forward, after the Civic Design Review committee and zoning board approved their design proposal and permits just this week. The Cecil Baker-designed tower, which will house 180 units, will be sandwiched by two historic brownstones: the Blue Horizon to the south and the Freedom Theater to the north. The one-story structure currently standing on the proposed site will be demolished.On Tuesday, the Civic Design Review committee voted to conclude the CDR process, though committee chair Nancy Rogo Trainer voted against it, citing concerns that the tower juts out in front of the Blue Horizon, calling its placement “overbearing.” The 197,946-square-foot project also went to the Zoning Board of Adjustment on Wednesday, requesting permits to erect a marquee in the front for the residential entrance; 180 units from the third to 17th floor; 13 parking spaces; and more than 70 bike spaces. The ZBA granted the request. Although the 197,946-square-foot project does tower above the two historic structures, Cecil Baker partner Christopher Blakelock noted that the height is in line with other new buildings along North Broad, including Temple’s 27-story Morgan Hall and the 15-story 1220 North Broad.

Lincoln Square mixed-use clears design committee hurdle,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/2/13497018/lincoln-square-project-approved-civic-design-review,article,"The design proposal for Lincoln Square, a mixed-use development proposed for the corner of South Broad Street and Washington Avenue, was approved by the Civic Design Review committee, though not without some critiques. “I applaud the developer for working with the historic building,” said committee chair Nancy Rogo-Trainer, “but I think the lower level of the main building needs as much love and attention as the upper part.” Rogo-Trainer, the only member to vote against conclusion of the CDR process, said it bottom half of the 9-story building “looks like a placeholder.” The upper levels of the building will consist of 322 apartments, some with inset balconies. Meanwhile, the first two stories of the new build will feature retail and restaurant tenants. The train shed will be restored and include a glassy addition that attempts to bridge the architectural details of the historic structure with the new apartment building. The design team also commented on the proposed Lincoln Walk, which is being proposed as a pedestrian pathway between the shed and the apartment building. The proposal also calls for a loading platform along this strip. Committee member Cecil Baker said, “As a citizen of Philadelphia, I’d feel better if you arranged the loading dock so that trucks can turn around instead of backing out onto 15th street.”The 286,170-square-foot project, which is co-developed by MIS Capital and Alterra Property Group, is expected to break ground next February, if not sooner, Steve Gendler of MIS Capital tells Curbed Philly.

"169 apartments, massive rock climbing gym planned for Fishtown",https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/2/13491688/fishtown-rock-climbing-gym-apartments-proposal,article,"A mixed-use residential building complete with a massive rock-climbing gym is in the works for Delaware Avenue in Fishtown, after clearing yesterday’s Civic Design Review meeting. Core Realty has proposed a new 85-foot-tall mixed-use building at 1100 Delaware Avenue that will adjoin an existing historic structure, the Ed Corner building. That will be an adaptive reuse project that will transform the building into 10 of 169 total residential units and ground-level retail. At the Civic Design Review meeting, the committee and members of the community thanked the developer and design team, Stanev Pott Architects, for incorporating the 3-story Ed Corner building into the proposal. Previously proposed projects were initially rejected by the Fishtown Neighbors Association because they called for demolishing the historic warehouse. The Ed Corner building is in “tough shape,” the developer said at the meeting. But they plan to restore as much as possible, including the facade, the windows, and the Ghost signs. Patrick Grossi, director of advocacy at the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia, commented that he hoped the project would serve as a model for future developments in the neighborhood and throughout the city. The new building, which is currently a parking lot, will house the rest of the apartments on the top five stories. Grid City Climbing has signed a 10-year lease with Core Realty for a 22,000-square-foot space.Committee chair Nancy Rogo-Trainer cautioned that more articulation along the facade of the rock-climbing gym on Allen Street may benefit the design so that residents of the rowhomes aren’t facing a monotonous charcoal wall. A design that’s more gentle in scale may be needed, she added.The design committee voted unanimously to conclude the CDR process. The project, which is zoned CMX-3, will be built by-right. "
Two high-rises proposed for archdiocese cathedral campus,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/28/13452956/philadelphia-archdiocese-cathedral-highrise-towers,article,"The Archdiocese of Philadelphia is dipping its toes into the real estate business with its proposal to build two high-rises by its historic Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in a major effort to boost its finances, according to reports. The plans call for two 33- and 44-story towers that would feature residential units, ground retail, a restaurant, and a 400 parking spaces. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that plans and renderings for the archdiocese campus were recently presented to the Logan Square Neighborhood Association. This time, officials anticipate extending a 99-year lease to a developer for a 2.2-acre, L-shaped parcel running to the north and east of the 1864 cathedral.No revenue targets have been set for the ground-lease deal, in which the archdiocese would retain ownership, and no developers have yet been approached about the opportunity, Croke said.Three buildings, including archdiocese’s administration building, would have to be demolished in order to build the two high-rises and proposed walkways. The archdiocese’s offices would then move into one of the towers. Nothing’s set in stone yet, as the project is still in the conceptual stage. The Inquirer has renderings and more on the proposed project.Update: Logan Square resident and PhillyChitChat’s HughE Dillon first wrote about the proposal on October 3. He shared some renderings with Curbed Philly. "
5 Philly neighborhoods everyone should be watching,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/26/13322180/philadelphia-neighborhoods-to-watch,article,"It has been a big, nay, huge year for Philly’s real estate and development scene. Home prices hit an all-time high since the housing bust, 30-plus high-rises are currently under construction or being renovated, walkable new construction is rampant, and the end of 2016 is still months away.""It’s fascinating,"" says John Calarco, owner of MGC Real Estate Group. ""I’ve been here for 20 years, and it’s amazing how much the city has grown.""And it’s still growing. Next year is poised to be another big one, especially up and down Broad Street, Grays Ferry, Kensington, and Market East. Why these five? Curbed Philly talked to real estate and development experts like Calarco who gave a long list of reasons, but they’re either on the cusp of revitalization, seeing an increase of density via apartments or housing, and, for better or worse, experiencing a hike in real estate values.The boom of North Broad is apparent as soon as one passes City Hall. Hanover North Broad, a mixed-use development consisting of two apartment buildings at the corners of Broad and Callowhill, has been rising since breaking ground earlier this year, and will serve as the gateway to North Broad when it opens in 2017.""It has the opportunity to be transformative,"" Hanover’s Adam Harbin said at the groundbreaking in February.Meanwhile, developer Eric Blumenfeld has been buying and fixing up historic properties on North Broad for years, from the Mural Arts Lofts to the Metropolitan Opera House to, of course, the ongoing $40M+ Divine Lorraine restoration. The historic apartment building is expected to finish up next year, and the re-lighting of its iconic signs will undoubtedly serve as a symbol of North Broad’s ongoing transition.South Broad has potential to become a ""world-class street,"" says developer Carl Dranoff, who got the ball rolling in this area with the Symphony House in 2007.Today, there are multiple hotels under construction or in the works nearby, including the Cambria Hotel and Dranoff’s impending SLS International Hotel, which at 45 stories will be the tallest residential building in the state.Meanwhile, the developers have moved even further down South Broad toward Washington Avenue. At that corner, two long-vacant lots will be transformed into mixed-use developments, including the Lincoln Square mixed-use, which is expected to break ground next year.""I think the story the next decade will be where South Philly meets Center City,"" says Dranoff. ""You’re seeing the boundaries of Center City going south and the boundaries of South Philadelphia going north—they kind of meet at Washington Avenue.""It was only a matter of time before Fishtown’s popularity spilled over into Kensington. Historically, the neighborhood has been mostly industrial, and today developers are eyeing its old warehouses and vacant lots for loft conversions and new builds.""The supply has been dwindling because so many developers have bought it up,"" says Calarco, whose company manages numerous properties in South Kensington.Low inventory means hiked housing prices. Since last year, the average house price in the Kensington/Frankford area has appreciated 9.5 percent, according to Drexel’s Lindy Institute. At South Square, a new 19-townhouse development managed by MGC, the asking price increased from the low $400Ks to $450,000 in the last five months.Even affordable vacant lots are harder to come by. Calarco says he’s seen the average price of vacant lots more than double in the last few years, rising from $40,000 to $90,000 and up.In addition to residential, retail and restaurants have popped up along Front Street, and ""Techadelphia,"" another innovation co-working space, is poised for American Street.""It’s becoming a village unto itself,"" says real estate agent Michael McCann.But it’s not just millennials who are drawn to the neighborhood. McCann says many of his clients also include empty nesters from the Main Line who can actually afford to build $400K+ homes in Kensington. ""You just can’t get new construction in Rittenhouse and Society Hill unless you spend $2.5 million,"" McCann says.Development is rampant east of Market Street, where the $600+ million East Market mixed-use project is quickly rising. ""I think that Market East is the culmination of many years of efforts to reverse blight and bring to new uses and energy to the east side of Market Street,"" says Dranoff.Not only will the East Market development include the first Mom’s Organic Market location in Philly and be home to the future Design Center of Philadelphia, but there will be not one, but two apartment towers. Across the street, construction has begun at the Gallery Mall, which will become the $575 million Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, spanning three city blocks.Given its prominent location, adds Dranoff, Market East is poised to become a ""connective tissue"" between Center City and the historic sites in Old City.As the University of Pennsylvania expands its campus into Grays Ferry with Pennovation, its eds and meds community is sure to follow. The neighborhood, which sits on the southwest edge of the Schuylkill River, has already seen signs of development in the form of rehabbed homes—it’s considered one of the top zip codes in the nation for house flipping.""Pennovation is going to be a new anchor and everything will fill in the donut hole between Grays Ferry and Pennovation,"" suggests Dranoff, whose high-rise One Riverside on the Schuylkill River Trail looks out to Grays Ferry.In addition, Penn’s mortgage assistance program has expanded to the neighborhood, which means university employees now have access to loans if they wish to buy in Grays Ferry, where property averages just $130 per square foot—the most affordable in the city.A mixed-use development has also been proposed for the corner of 25th and Washington Avenue, featuring single-family homes and multi-unit dwellings. Though still in the design process, the goal of the project is to increase walkability in the area.""I look at Grays Ferry and say that it’s the new bullseye,"" says Dranoff, ""because the boardwalk is being extended. People will be able to easily walk, bike, jog, dog sled, whatever, between Center City and Grays Ferry."" "
Here are more Divine Lorraine floor plans to ogle over,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/25/13401984/divine-lorraine-floor-plans-restaurant,article,"We’ve known for some time now that the Divine Lorraine has been actively seeking restaurant tenants, but these floor plans offer even more information of what’s to come on the lower levels at the historic apartment building. The plan for the first floor has always been for two restaurants to sandwich the lobby, which is currently being restored. Based on this floor plan, CBRE is looking for a bi-level restaurant on one side, and a cafe on the other. The bi-level restaurant will continue down to the lower level. In addition, looks like there’s a place for a retail boutique in the back of the lobby, as well as a community lounge for residents. On the lower level, there’s also been talk for a speakeasy lounge. And on the other side of the floor, the plans call for a 1,134-square-foot fitness center. A restaurant in the annex building, which will be converted into a boutique hotel, will also be on this level. It also looks like there are plans for outdoor space along Ridge Avenue. The $40-plus million restoration project is expected to be complete in spring 2017. The apartments are on track to be move-in ready by the end of the year. "
Jewelers Row buildings inch forward in historic designation process,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/21/13359940/jewelers-row-toll-brothers-historic-nominations,article,"Three buildings on Jewelers Row nominated for historic designation have cleared the first hurdle of the process, although their ultimate fate won’t be decided until November. The nominations for the properties at 704 and 706-708 Sansom Street were accepted by the Philadelphia Historical Commission panel on Friday, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The Preservation of Alliance of Greater Philadelphia nominated the three buildings soon after Toll Brothers’ plans to demolish them were revealed in August. The Philadelphia Historical Commission will decide on November 10 whether or not to accept the properties into the city’s register of historic places. But because the demolition permits were already approved, it’s likely that the historic designations won’t prevent the buildings from being razed. "

Plans were announced back in 2008.The tower will be located at 10th and Vine streets and will feature 21,000 square feet of office space, 8,700 square feet of retail space, 17,000 square feet of recreation and event space, and 150 high-rise residential units.According to the announcement, construction should take about one year after breaking ground, finishing up in fall 2017.

Designers release new Lincoln Square renderings and video,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/20/13344200/lincoln-square-renderings-civic-design-review,article,"New renderings of Lincoln Square, the mixed-use development proposed for 1000 South Broad Street, have been released ahead of an upcoming Civic Design Review and provide a clearer idea of how a historic train shed will be incorporated into the site.The official design proposal calls for an addition onto the train shed at 15th and Carpenter that will be used as a grocery store, with a public plaza on the corner of 15th and Broad. KM Architects are designing the actual addition, while BLT Architects are the official architects of the project.Developers Alterra Property Group and MIS Capital have not released who the grocery retailer will be.The historic train shed once served as a major hub for the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Baltimore Railroad line and was a funeral stop of President Abraham Lincoln after his assassination. Hence the development’s name, Lincoln Square.In addition, the renderings of the 9-story mixed-use residential building looks slightly different from previous renditions and now features mostly gray, metal paneling. The designers say that material was chosen to complement Washington Avenue’s long history as an industrial hub. The number of residential units has slightly decreased from 356 to 322. There will also be a parking garage with 455 spaces north of the main building on 15th Street.This week, BLT Architects also released a new video series called ""The Life of a Building,"" which includes a feature on Lincoln Square and how they came up with the schematic design. In the 3:40-minute video, the architects talk about their goals of designing ""units of various types, but also providing a variety to the actual facade itself.""

But when the property officially opens in November, it may be the views that up the building’s wow factor.Developed by Brandywine Realty Trust and LCOR, 1919 Market is the latest luxury residential high-rise to open in Philly. It began construction in 2014 and began moving in residents back in March. As of this week, it’s 63 percent leased.A recent tour of the property gave Curbed Philly a sneak peek of the views from the 26th and 27th floors of the building, which will include 16 penthouses. The biggest penthouse, still under construction, clocks in at 1,458 square feet and features a wrap-around deck with views of West Philly and Center City.The penthouses are the top tier of three rental options in the building, along with the Tower Collection and City Collection. In addition to their bigger square footage, the penthouses will include three bedrooms, varied custom cabinetry, and massive, custom-built walk-in closets.The very top floor, though, is reserved for the building’s amenities and is already open to residents. It features a gym with views of the second Comcast Tower rising, a gourmet kitchen and dining room, a media room, a game simulation area, and a bar and billiards room. Still in the works is the roof top pool, which was delayed as they wait for custom 8-foot-tall glass panels to be prepped and installed. In addition, the pool is deeper than originally planned.Yet the November opening won’t keep folks from swimming—it’s designed so that the temperature can be increased up to 40 degrees warmer than the actual temperature. That will allow it to be a 3.5-season pool.Rents range from $1,770 for a studio to $3,800 and up for a 2-bedroom. The penthouses will be available for lease in the next coming weeks.

The Studebaker Building on North Broad is now leasing,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/13/13246374/studebaker-building-north-broad-leasing,article,"Now that the rainbow-colored panels have been stripped away, revealing the original brick facade, the Studebaker Building is ready to find new tenants to lease its space along the burgeoning North Broad corridor.Construction has been underway for months at what was once a Studebaker manufacturing plant and showroom, and developer Eric Blumenfeld has long had plans to transform the 43,400-square-foot property into another restaurant and retail hub.In most recent years, it’s been home to Steven Starr’s Catering Group, which was bought by Trust House in 2015. EB Realty’s vice president Chris Cordaro says with the new acquisition, Trust House doubled their office size. ""So we are expanding their offices and moving them to second floor because they are the bigger tenant.""Trust House is expected to move in by the end of this year, which is when the facade should be finished up, too.Otherwise, the rest of the building is still looking for tenants to fill the 13,400 square feet of retail on the first floor and 30,000 square feet of space on the second and third floors. There’s also potential for a 20,000-square-foot roof deck.The building is being marketed as the ""New Design District of NoBo,"" but Cordaro says they’re looking for tenants with a bent toward education, daytime work, and the arts.""Restaurants are our forte, and I think the ground level will be some sort of retail and or restaurant,"" he says. ""Then, the upper level will be more traditional day-time use, either office space or education-based."" "

500 Walnut tower to top off by end of year,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/10/13226038/500-walnut-construction-photos,article,"500 Walnut, the ultra-luxurious condo building that’s on the rise at the last open site behind Independence Hall, is on track to top off by the end of this year.""Finally, the construction progress is visible,"" developer Tom Scannapieco tells Curbed Philly. ""For a long time, we were working underground and you couldn’t see any of it.""When the 26-story residential tower is fully built—it broke ground in 2014—it will feature 35 high-end, 3- to 4-bedroom units, which are fetching some of the most expensive asking prices in the city. Designed by Cecil Baker + Partners, the skinny building was designed to boast views of Independence Hall without obstructing the views of the historical park from the mall.Half of the units have been sold, says Scannapieco, who in June broke his own real estate record by selling the 8,900-square-foot penthouse at 500 Walnut for $17.85 million, the most expensive residential sale in Philadelphia’s history.But there’s still plenty of work to be done. One of the many amenities expected at 500 Walnut is the robotic parking garage, which parks and retrieves residents’ cars for them, turning a 15-minute valet process into a two-minute task. ""We had to plan that early on in designing the building because it’s very specific in its architectural requirements,"" says Scannapieco, who also included the feature in his first project 1706 Rittenhouse.Currently, the car chamber is being built and the equipment is being manufactured. It’s expected to be installed in the next two to three months, he says.Once the building is built, the residents’ own units will be constructed. ""It’s a project that is meant to appeal to the high-end buyer and it’s designed in ways that encourage customization,"" says Scannapieco.""Most of the times in high-rise environments, developers attempt to minimize change, but we know that our buyers are going to want to customize their units so we go to great extents to try to facilitate their ability to make changes.""For example, they increased the thickness of the concrete floors to reduce the number of columns in each unit. Plumbing fixtures locations were also considered, in order to allow residents to pick and choose where they want their bathrooms and kitchens located.Scannapieco says the building is ""going up a story every week,"" and the first move-in is scheduled for May or June of next year.

Mysterious 8th and Market rendering was meant for 8th and Chestnut,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/7/13198652/disney-hole-rendering-8th-and-chestnut,article,"Earlier this week a Curbed reader tipped us off about a mixed-use high-rise proposed for 8th and Market. A watercolor rendering revealing a super-tall tower for the corner that had folks thinking that something was finally in the works for the so-called Disney Hole. But when we talked to the alleged developer behind the project, Goldenberg Group, they asserted that the rendering was definitely not theirs, and that any plans they had for 8th and Market had not been released. So where did that mysterious rendering come from? First, some eagle-eyed commenters helpfully pointed out that the rendering was actually of a proposed high-rise located at 8th and Chestnut, not Market. It’s a smaller parking lot next to the Disney Hole that’s currently owned by the Philadelphia Parking Authority (PPA). A Goldenberg Group representative also says that a top executive recalls that the rendering was likely commissioned by Clark Realty Capital in the early 2000s for an RFP issued by the PPA. The RFP was not awarded. Curbed Philly reached out to Clark Realty Capital and PPA, and will update this article if we hear from either party. The watercolor conceptual rendering itself was created by Genesis Studios, which is a Florida-based company that specializes in architectural rendering, illustrations, and scale modeling, according to its website. The rendering of 8th and Chestnut can be found under “watercolor renderings.” So there you have it. Both corners of 8th and Market and 8th and Chestnut are still parking lots in the middle of Market East, where major re-development projects are happening literally left and right, from East Market to the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia. Even though this old rendering never came to fruition, it’s only a matter of time before something(s) pops up on this block, right?"
Jewelers Row appeals rejected by zoning board,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/6/13186484/zba-jewelers-row-appeals-rejected,article,"Things got heated at yesterday’s Zoning Board of Adjustment hearing yesterday, where the board ultimately rejected preservationists’ and merchants’ appeals against L&I-issued permits.According to multiple reports, the hearings lasted 90 minutes and involved a number of heated exchanges between those testifying and Toll Brothers’ lawyer. The hearing was a continuation of last week’s hearing on the same issue, which also ended with some angry outbursts.The Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and some merchants filed appeals against Licenses and Inspections, arguing that owners were not properly notified about demolition permits that had been issued for 702-710 Sansom Streets and 128 S. 7th Street, a string of properties along Jewelers Row.The plan is for Toll Brothers to build a 16-story residential tower on the site with retail on the ground level.PlanPhilly reports that the zoning board met briefly after the hearing and voted quickly to reject their appeals. Meanwhile, a representative for Toll Brothers told Philadelphia Inquirer that they were ""pleased with the outcome"" and ""remain committed to delivering a residential building that is respectful of the history of Jewelers Row while rejuvenating it for the future.""Proponents of saving the Jewelers Row properties will now seek historic designation of 704 and 706-708 Sansom Street at the next historical commission meeting on October 21.Trouble keeping up? Here’s a brief timeline of the Jewelers Row saga."
Developer: 8th and Market tower rendering not accurate,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/5/13173520/disney-hole-mixed-use-tower-rendering-8th-market,article,"UPDATE: A representative from Goldenberg Group reached out to Curbed Philly and said that the tip about a proposed mixed-use tower at 8th and Market is not true and that the conceptual rendering shared by a reader is not theirs. Although 8th and Market is listed on their website, they say they have not released any plans regarding the project.Big plans may be in the works for the large parking lot at 8th and Market street (otherwise known as the Disney Hole for reasons we’ll get to later), according to a Curbed reader’s tip.Local developer Goldenberg Group has proposed to build a 450-foot mixed-use tower at 800 Market Street. It’s still very much in the conceptual phase, but something is definitely in the works the reader says.At the time of publication, calls and emails to the developer were not returned to Curbed Philly. The property, however, is currently listed on Goldenberg’s website under the ""In Development"" tab, though no further details are provided.Here is the conceptual rendering of the mixed-use tower, which Warner shared with Curbed Philly via social media.Big News. Philadelphia getting a new 450ft + mixed use high-rise @ 8/Market Disney Hole. Phase I of project. @CurbedPhilly pic.twitter.com/zjWNBX2DNEAnd for reference, here’s the parking lot that it would replace:Re-development of the massive parking lot was bound to happen, especially with the neighborhood’s ongoing resurgence with the East Market development. Back in the late 1990s, the parcel almost became home to DisneyQuest, an indoor amusement park. But despite the city pouring millions of dollars into the project, it ultimately flopped, leaving a construction site that became known as the Disney Hole.Eventually, it was paved over and has served as a large surface parking lot in the heart of Market East ever since. (You can read more about the site’s history at Philly Bricks.)If something were to be built here, its neighbors would be the eventual Gallery Mall-turned-Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia at 9th and Market and the extended-stay residences at AKA Washington Square, which is currently undergoing a multi-million renovation.Got a tip?

Civic Design Review approves 4 of 7 major projects in marathon meeting,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/5/13166106/philadelphia-civic-design-review-october-recap,article,"A record-breaking seven design proposals were presented to the Civic Design Review committee yesterday, including the Philadelphia Housing Authority’s Sharswood project that prompted committee member and architect Cecil Baker to say, ""It’s a sad day for the CDR.""But not all of the design proposals disappointed Baker and other committee members. Of the seven projects reviewed, four were approved to move forward, and the rest were asked to return for another go at it. Here is how each major development fared at yesterday’s CDR meeting:↑ PHA’s Headquarters (2013 Ridge Avenue)—This was the PHA’s second visit to the CDR after the design team was asked to address some major comments by the committee in September. Yet BLT Architects made little changes to their original design proposal, save for some minor tweaks to the public plaza to make it less suburban-like.Baker said of the proposal, ""I think it’s a sad day for the CDR, when a quasi-city agency is dealing with another city agency and has created no conversation. [...] I just feel sad.""Vote: Concluded by default, since projects are only required to visit the CDR twice at most.↑ Aramark’s new headquarters (2402-2414 Market Street)—Fresh off the big announcement of Aramark’s move to 2400 Market, Gensler presented its plans for the property with a focus on the public plaza on the Schuylkill Banks. The current building will double in size, tacking on an extra five stories on top with retail on the ground floor. Yet the committee argued that more needed to be done to ensure that the public space truly felt open to all.Said committee chair Nancy Rogo Trainer, ""I should be able to not just to buy lunch here, but also feel like I can bring my lunch to this public space and eat it here, too."" In addition, the design team was called out for not seeking any sustainable certifications on the project.Vote: Continue the CDR process. Developer PMC Property Group says it will return in 30 days.↑ Hyatt Centric Hotel (1612 Chancellor Street)—After more than a year of ""will it or won’t it,"" the public found out that a Hyatt Centric Hotel was indeed coming to 17th and Chancellor when renderings were posted to CDR’s website in late September. DAS Architects says one of the hotel’s main goals is to enliven the streetscape to make it more inviting for pedestrians. The ground floor will feature either a high-end retailer or a restaurant, and the second floor will be the lobby and main public space, as well as another potential restaurant.Vote: Conclude the CDR process.↑ 4th and Callowhill (309-315 Callowhill Street & 444 N. 3rd Street)—This Cecil Baker + Partners-designed project will bring two 23- and 26-story residential towers to a mostly industrial area between Old City and Northern Liberties. The design was partially driven by the East Callowhill zoning overlay (ECO), which was passed to encourage more mixed-use development.The project is using stormwater management, a public space, mixed-income, and retail for added height bonuses that are within the ECO. The developer said they have no intention of backing out of that agreement, hinting toward PMC Property Group’s recent bait-and-switch move over at One Water Street.Vote: Conclude the CDR process.↑ 2501 Washington Avenue—This proposal calls for 17 single-family townhomes, two 2-family dwellings, and another 5-story mixed-use development with 64 multi-family dwellings on the fairly drab corner of 25th and Washington in Grays Ferry. The goal is to enliven the corner with retail on the ground and basement levels of the mixed-use building, and make the area a more walkable neighborhood.Vote: Conclude the CDR process.↑ 1845 Hartranft Street—Down in South Philly, this DesignBlendz project calls for 34 residences with 28 garages and 12 parking spaces. While the interior courtyard of the calls for a sort of green wall option to bring some life to the development, the committee said the building materials facing the rest of the neighborhood are ""particularly ungenerous.""Vote: Continue the CDR process.↑ 4440-42 Ridge Avenue—This Harman Deutsch-designed proposal for a 136-unit mixed-use development would be neighbors to the already approved Ridge Flats development  at 4300 Ridge Avenue and Falls Bridge Lofts next door. But the committee called the design uninspiring and said that there are some missed opportunities with the current design proposal, including better connections to the Schuylkill River Trail and Kelly Drive.Vote: Continue the CDR process.Here's the final results from today's Civic Design Review Committee meeting #cdr pic.twitter.com/HAZLlA5TUA"
Rail Park to begin construction by end of year with $3.5M state grant,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/9/30/13123990/rail-park-racp-state-grant-groundbreaking,article,"With a $3.5 million state grant now in its back pocket, construction on phase 1 of the Rail Park is expected to begin this year.""I’m ecstatic,"" says Michael Garden, vice president of the Rail Park’s board of directors.Center City District, which is managing the project’s construction, was awarded a $3.5 million grant from the Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program today, along with a long list of other projects in Philadelphia including Gallery Mall. The grant was the final push the Rail Park needed to break ground on the $9.6 million first phase.The state budget impasse has delayed the Rail Park groundbreaking month and after month, to the point that some questioned whether the project would ever become reality. Not that the CCD and Rail Park haven’t been trying to drum up support for the project. With already $5.1 million raised in January, actor Kevin Bacon’s band hosted a concert earlier this year to raise more funds, and the Philadelphia Horticultural Society chose a site right by the Rail Park as a pop-up park this summer. The proposed park itself even underwent a re-branding to raise more awareness throughout the city.""We're grateful to the state and the city for supporting phase 1 of our vision for this transformative, three-mile, linear rail park,"" says Garden.It's happening!! Link in bio for more news A photo posted by The Rail Park (@therailpark) on Sep 30, 2016 at 8:56am PDT The exact date for the groundbreaking will be up to the CCD, but it’s expected to be this fall, if not by the end of the year, based on a conversation Garden had with the district’s president Paul Levy earlier today.When it does break ground, construction is projected to last a full year on the .25-mile stretch of the Rail Park.Garden says he plans to continue leading his street-level tours along the Reading Viaduct Rail Line during construction.

Massive Globe Dye Works in Frankford hits market for $7.5M,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/9/30/13120584/globe-dye-works-factory-for-sale,article,"An old yarn-dyeing factory-turned-artistic haven in the Frankford section of Philadelphia has hit the market to the tune of $7.5 million.Globe Dye Works, a collection of 10 industrial buildings that houses tenants like Rival Bros. Coffee and Philadelphia Wooden Boat Factory, is looking for a new owner willing to take the reigns from a group of investors who have spent the past seven years transforming the massive 145,000-square-foot property into a workplace for artists and artisans.""It’s clearly been a labor of love for the current owner group, which consists of seven investors,"" says listing agent Christopher Plant. ""It really is in many senses, the perfect picture of what that intersection between art and commerce and architecture is supposed to look like.""Built between 1867 and 1895, Globe Dye was originally a major hub for the dyeing and bleaching industry. It closed its doors in 2005, until two years later when Globe Development Group LP bought the property for $675,000, according to public records.It’s been a huge undertaking, and Plant says there’s still some 40,000-plus square feet of space still available for development. Currently, 68,000-square-feet is tenant occupied, and the developers have been working to renovate some of the available space into a live-work situation.So why are they selling? ""Several of the owners have the possibility of other options,"" says Plant, who adds that there are already a handful of investors who have expressed interest.But the hope is that whoever buys the property will continue with the current setup. ""They are certainly hoping whomever takes over the project seeks to keep it as an arts-friendly and small, manufacturing-friendly environment.""

Last year’s state budget impasse has held up multiple projects throughout Philadelphia, including the Gallery Mall, Carl Dranoff’s SLS luxury hotel, and the Rail Park.According to the press release, the grant will go toward improving the exterior facade that connects the mall to public transportation; installing new mechanical systems; replacing escalators and elevators; and sprucing up pedestrian walkways to notable attractions like City Hall and Independence Mall.The $10 million state grant brings the project’s grand total of tax subsidies to $100 million, reports the Philadelphia Business Journal.

"After 30 years, South Philly's Snyder Plaza starts revitalization with mural makeover",https://philly.curbed.com/2016/9/29/13093324/murals-at-swanson-walk-snyder-plaza,article,"Thirty years ago, a local development company debuted a retail hub in South Philly. Though called Snyder Plaza, it was really more like a large swath of surface parking lots surrounded with big-box stores.It was Goldenberg Group’s first project in Philadelphia, a 316,537-square-foot retail hub that, given its proximity to I-95, attracted car-drivers to run errands and buy up home goods.But that was three decades ago, when car-friendly, suburban-like shopping centers were all the rage. Times are different, and Goldenberg Group is returning to its first stomping grounds—of its 7 million-square-foot portfolio, it now owns an impressive 1 million square feet from at Snyder and Columbus Avenue alone—for another go at it, starting with a mural makeover.On Friday, the Goldenberg Group and the Mural Arts program will be debuting Murals at Swanson Walk, four murals by local- and nationally-recognized artists adorning the walls of stores like Marshall’s, Rite-Aid, and Kicks USA. Not only will the debut party mark the launch of Mural Arts Month, but it will be the start of Goldenberg Group's long-term project to re-imagine Snyder Plaza.Day 11 Done! Thank you to The Goldenberg Group, @muralarts for the opportunity, @ryansgreenberg for managing the project and @andrewjeffreywright for helping out!

""This was a really interesting opportunity to go back to Snyder Plaza, our first project, and take a look at how we can make significant improvements to the center itself.""Goldenberg Group reached out to the Mural Arts Program last year about partnering on Snyder Plaza, though developer Ken Goldenberg and founder Jane Golden go back to the 1980s when Golden first moved to Philly.""Given that Jane and Ken are both really dynamic, thoughtful people who love this city, I think they’ve been thinking about partnering for three decades,"" says Rosenberg. ""They both just are excited and energetic and want to do good things for the city.""After considering a slew of artists, Goldenberg Group chose Steve Powers, Peter Ferrari, and local artists Joe Boruchow and Isaac Lin.""There was no specific theme, in reality it was just an eclectic group of different kinds of artists who have different backgrounds and followings,"" says Rosenberg of how they chose the artists. Mural at Swanson Walk is just the start of Goldenberg’s multi-year plan to reinvent Snyder Plaza. Official plans have yet to be released, although Rosenberg says that they will include not just capital improvements, but also new stores, public spaces, improved walkways, and better connections to the neighborhoods. The retail hub is currently separated from the surrounding South Philly neighborhoods by the interstate.

A photo posted by Joe Boruchow (@joeboruchow) on Sep 26, 2016 at 5:07am PDTThat's why teaming up with Mural Arts made sense as the first step in Snyder Plaza's re-do, she adds.

Jewelers Row: ZBA delays decision on appeals until October,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/9/28/13096410/jewelers-row-zoning-board-meeting-recap,article,"The Zoning Board of Adjustment decided to continue discussion of appeals filed by preservationists and tenants of multiple properties on Jewelers Row until October after an attorney in the room called the arguments ""petty"" and ""offensive"" to the board.The ZBA this afternoon was scheduled to consider five appeals regarding zoning permits issued by Licenses and Inspections (L&I) for 128 S. 7th Street and 702, 704, 706-08, and 710 Sansom Street. The apellants argued that L&I did not properly post notices of the permits to the properties at the time that they were issued.The only zoning permit that was posted was on the 7th street property, which is around the corner from the properties on Jewelers Row.L&I is required to post a notice of an issued zoning permit onto each respective property, which allows potential appellants to file an appeal within 30 days of notice. The appellants in this case, which included Paul Steinke of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and Maryanne Ritter, a tenant at 704 Sansom, argued that the average person walking by could misconstrue the one sign, assuming that it’s just the one property that will be demolished.A city representative agreed that L&I did not post the permits, save for the one at 7th Street. Yet Ronald J. Patterson, legal representative for Toll Brothers, argued that the failure to post the notices does not validate filing the appeals. In addition, he said Toll Brothers was authorized to file the permits since they are equitable owners with the current owners.After an hour of talks, including one outburst from an attorney in the room who shouted at the Alliance’s legal representative that ""this is not a game"" and was a waste of the board’s time, the ZBA decided to delay a decision on the five appeals until October 5.By then, word on the street is that Toll Brothers may have a design to show for their proposed 16-story residential tower.

They argue that tenants were not properly notified about the demolition permits that the L&I approved.Toll Brothers plans to demolish five properties on Jewelers Row to build a 16-story residential tower with ground-floor retail. Because the row is zoned CMX-5, the developer is allowed to build the structure by-right. The properties are not designated historic.Opponents of the project have been working to delay the demolition ever since the news was announced in August. In addition to the appeals, two of the properties have also been nominated for historic designation.Proponents of the tower include Hy Golberg, Jewelers Row Association president. At a recent panel discussion about Jewelers Row, he told a packed room that 90 percent of the business owners in the diamond district were in favor of the development. That number is based on replies to an email blast sent out to a listserv of members of the association, Golberg said.Golberg says he has been ""very heavily talking to Toll Brothers"" in recent weeks. At a meeting with the developers right before the panel discussion, he said he asked to see their design proposal for the residential tower.The renderings will come sometime in October, they told him.Tomorrow’s ZBA hearing is at 1 p.m. at 1515 Arch Street, 18th floor."

That's also when construction is expected to finish up.The luxury apartment building began construction in 2014 and began moving in residents earlier this year in March. It features a fitness center with city views that just recently opened. Come October, when construction is complete, there will be a roof top pool, a parking garage, and a media room, plus a slew of other amenities you probably never thought you needed: A wine room and a kitchen demonstration room, for example.All of that comes with a cost: Rents range from $1,600 for a studio to $3,500 for a 2-bedroom apartment.

Barricades go up around Jewelers Row potential demo site,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/9/13/12900826/jewelers-row-demolition-site-toll-brothers-philadelphia,article,"Fences and barricades have gone up around five properties on Jewelers Row that may be demolished to make way for a residential tower developed by Toll Brothers.Hidden City Philadelphia, which has been a strong advocate for preserving the buildings, posted a photo to Instagram yesterday of the current site. But while it may appear that the demolition is underway, readers say that the construction workers are drilling down to test the bedrock.Although the developers pulled demolition permits earlier this summer, the plans to build a 16-story apartment building must first go through the Civic Design Review process before construction can begin. The proposal for the structure is more than 100,000 square feet, triggering the review.Not liking the looks of this. Barricades and fencing just went up around 702-710 Samson Street--the five buildings on #JewelersRow under threat of demolition. We understand that developer #tollbrothers, who plan to raze 1/8th of the historic diamond and publishing district for a 15 story condominium tower, must have their plan approved by the Civic Design Review committee before demolition can begin. This prep work kind of flies in the face of that conditional zoning permit and the developer's alleged commitment to working with merchants, neighbors, and @presalliancephl, no?  #savejewelersrow #thisplacematters #worldheritagecity #buildphlA photo posted by Hidden City Philadelphia (@hiddencityphila) on Sep 12, 2016 at 2:54pm PDT In addition, the Philadelphia Historical Commission has agreed to consider nominations to add three of the properties to the historic register on October 21. However, Licenses and Inspections told the Philadelphia Inquirer that this will not delay the demolition process, as the permits were pulled before the nominations.Meanwhile, the online petition by the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia to save Jewelers Row has surpassed 6,000 signatures.

Foss, Aramark’s chairman, president, and CEO said at the announcement on Cira Greene. ""The answer was right in front of us all along.""Philadelphia Business Journal first reported earlier this year that Aramark was looking for a new headquarters, potentially outside of Philadelphia and the state. The move might have been a big blow to the city and state, as it's one of the largest international corporations headquartered in Philly.After working with Governor Tom Wolfe and the Kenney administration, Aramark said it remain in Pennsylvania, though it wasn't clear whether the company's headquarters would remain at 1100 Market. Foss announced that the food distribution company’s new headquarters will relocate 13 blocks down Market Street into the former Hudson Motor Car Company plant.The plan calls to transform the existing structure into a a modern, 600,000-square-foot, nine-story building. Aramark, the anchor tenant, says it will occupy the top five floors and 300,000 square feet of space.Designed by architecture firm Gensler, with Varenhorst serving as the executive architect, the building has been in the works for some time, now, undergoing a number of revisions. Today, the design plan emphasizes green space, innovation, and sustainability—the three criteria that Foss says Aramark was looking for in its new headquarters.There will be a ""state of the art"" dining facility for the company’s 1,200 associates that will be moving to 2400 Market, as well as spaces for collaboration and a fitness center. In keeping with the company’s green goals, the plan calls for 8,000 square feet of outdoor terraces.The design proposal still has to receive city approval. A previous proposal was supposed to go to the Civic Design Review in May, but was pulled last minute by the developer, PMC Property Group.If all goes to plan, however, Aramark says it plans to make its big move in fall 2018. In the meantime, a bright red billboard will sit on top of the existing structure, above the iconic big, blue whale mural (which, according to the renderings, will not be preserved in the renovations). The billboard reads, ""Aramark: Home Sweet Home."""

Tycher, chairman of Roseland Residential, said during the call.Plans to build the 300-unit residential tower were first announced in March 2015, a time when Market East was beginning its re-development boom with developers like Keystone Property Group and National Real Estate Development buying up properties left and right.In general, the city has been in the midst of a building boom, and was recently named the top city for walkable new construction. And since 2014, 70 percent of apartment construction in Philadelphia has been on the high-end.Yet Jacob Adelman writes that Mack-Cali Realty Corp.’s decision to drop the project may be a sign that Philly’s apartment boom may be slowing down, at least for out-of-town developers who may have a hard time ""making their numbers"" with rising construction and labor costs and increase of supply.

Prifti presented plans for what’s being called the West Tower of East Market located at 1100 Market Street. As reported in August when renderings were first released, the second 22-story tower will add 240 apartments to the project and feature a garden terrace and an amenity level.Prifti explained that they are aiming for the building to be LEED Silver certified ""if not better than that."" In addition, the goal with the West Tower’s look is to pay homage to the iconic PSFS Building next door without impeding it. Though nowhere near as tall as the PSFS Building, the West Tower will be clad in black brick and also have a curved base. The tower that will rise from the retail base has been positioned in the center so as to prevent obstructing views of the PSFS Building.The design committee had little to say post-presentation, given the fact that the overall East Market project already went through the CDR process in 2014. At that time, there were talks of the West Tower overbuild, but it wasn’t clear what purpose the site would serve.Today, the first phase of the $600 million East Market project is already well underway, with some retail expected to open as early as this fall. Prifti also says the Eastern Tower is halfway to topping out. "

But the interior of the building has been left open and exposed, allowing passersby to peek through the dusty windows at what’s left of the mall.The Gallery opened in 1977 and underwent some expansions over the years. PREIT began acquiring parts of the property in the early 2000s, and announced plans for the redevelopment in 2014. By 2015, the Gallery closed for good, awaiting renovations.The Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia is one big part of Market East’s revitalization. Developers PREIT and partner Macerich had planned for the outlets to open in 2017, but that date was pushed back to 2018 due to negotiations with the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority, according to CBS 3. When all is said and done, the 730,000-square-foot redevelopment will span three blocks and feature 125 retail outlets."

The partnership announced a feasibility study that lasted six months and cost Crystal Cruises $1 million.A team of engineers, maritime experts, and divers concluded that the 1950s SS United States is, in fact, structurally sound. But, according to the announcement released on Friday, ""the technical and commercial challenges associated with returning the historic liner to service as a modern cruise ship have unfortunately proven insurmountable."" In greater detail, they report:[. . .] Modifying the ship for today’s standards for oceangoing service (SOLAS) would require significant changes to the hull that would pose stability challenges. Additionally, the installation of a modern, state-of-the-art diesel electric propulsion plant would have necessitated altering of the existing shaft lines and rebuilding about 25 percent of the hull to reconfigure the ship to a twin shaft-twin rudder arrangement.The announcement means the conservancy is once again going back to the drawing board, and re-considering its initial idea of turning the ship into a sort of stationary mixed-use development with a museum, restaurants, hotels, and/or offices. Crystal Cruises said it will donate $350,000 to the conservancy."

All 20 homes have roof decks.Those price tags are pretty on par with the median price of homes in Graduate Hospital, which hovers around $429,000.

The committee voted to continue the design review process for a second round, and the developers returned for another presentation this month.One of the biggest concerns of the design proposal this time around concerned Amber Street, which faces a series of rowhouses. Community members questioned whether driving traffic along Amber—entrance to parking would be on this side of the property—was the best option for the narrow street.Committee member Cecil Baker also suggested enlarging the lobby on this side to create a more generous entry space, potentially at the cost of parking spots and office space. The committee also suggested closing one end of the parking lot to reduce congestion and eliminate a curb cut.The developers said they would consider the committee's suggestions.

 Perkins + Will presented the design proposal for Penn Medicine’s 3600 Civic Center Boulevard 18-story tower. The building, which will house hospital staff, will be a white, pre-cast concrete structure built in two phases, architect Robert Goodwin said.In order to enliven Civic Center Boulevard and create an active presence along the street, the designers proposed an entry-way plaza that will be open to the public and lead to a two-story atrium lobby with a public cafe. A daycare will also be on this level that will include a brightly-colored outdoor space for kids with native planting, Goodwin said.The design committee praised the design for its decision to make the front lobby open to the public.""The use of the main floor for the public is just great,"" said committee member Michael Johns. ""People will be able to meander and learn—it’s just very nice.""Johns suggested making the two green roof tops accessible to the hospital staff and ultimately the committee voted to conclude the CDR process.

 The University of Sciences’ proposed dormitory at 4514-22 Woodland Avenue also presented to the CDR for the first time. Design Collective is behind the design of the mixed-use building, which will sit on the site of the shuttered Alexander Wilson Public School.Architect Nick Mansperger said the goal of the design was to create a building that ""invites the community to participate."" With that idea, they designed a C-shaped building with a public courtyard in the center surrounded by classrooms and retail on the ground level.The mostly brick building will be six stories tall and feature study rooms on the corners that will be lit 24/7, said Mansperger. In addition, they plan to repurpose the murals currently on the school building. One mural that runs along 46th and features neighbors who still live across the street, will be converted into a translucent graphic that will be backlit against the classroom windows.The project will require six zoning variances, but Cecil Baker said in this case that’s a good thing: ""The extra height [of the building] isn’t an issue because of the great public space. This is what zoning is meant to encourage."" "

Not much, if anything, has changed from its first design proposal that we wrote about in June.The plans call for a 176,000-square-foot retail and residential development that will include 20,000 square feet of commercial space on the ground level, 14,500 square feet of office space, and 178 residential units on top of retail. Next on the docket is 3600 Civic Center Boulevard Tower on Penn’s campus in University City. The 2.4-acre site is currently a parking garage and open space where the university hospital plans to build 484,773-square-foot mixed-use tower called the UPHS Center for Healthcare Technology.Designed by Perkins + Will, the architecture firm behind Penn’s Biomedical Research Building, the proposal calls for a glass, aluminum, and concrete 18-story structure.

At the time, the project was in the preliminary stages and renderings were not made public.The proposal calls for a 44,340-square-foot mixed-use development that will make use of the existing school structure.

""There’s just so much going on down there. It’s becoming another part of Center City that is on the riverfront of the Delaware River.""That’s why Ciurlino put the properties for sale in one $3.9 million bundle because he says together they could make for a ""really nice mixed-use development,"" with potential to continue a line of retail along the corridor.

Eight new campus buildings, three of which will be dorms, will be constructed as part of the master plan.The university’s campus does fall within the Wissahickon Watershed in East Falls, and staff member Paula Brumbelow said the re-districting would not exempt the college from complying with the environmental regulations. Each building constructed will have to go through the Civic Design Review process and receive zoning approval.Two members of the public—one a resident of East Falls and the other from Lancaster—spoke against approval of the master plan, citing concerns of heat islands due to new construction and lack of campus swales, which control water runoff.Similar concerns were also presented at the Civic Design Review meeting earlier this month. The committee narrowly approved the design proposal 5 to 3.The planning commission’s approval marks the fourth hurdle cleared in a 12-step approval process for the university’s master plan.↑ The planning commission also voted in favor of Ridge Flats, a large mixed-use development also planned for East Falls. The design proposal for the 206-unit building was approved by the CDR in May, where the committee suggested making the wall along Ridge Avenue less drab by adding more programming. Yet according to planning staff member Jack Conviser, the plans presented at yesterday’s meeting did not indicate any changes to the design proposal.Nancy Rogo-Trainer, chair of the CDR, opposed the approval.Ridge Flats now goes to the Zoning Board of Appeals on August 10.↑ The commission voted in favor of the staff’s recommendation to approve 600-24 North 5th Street, a development slated for Northern Liberties that will include 43 single-family townhomes and 53 parking spaces.

Doing so would allow the school to develop on its campus without the need to seek approval from the East Falls community for variances over the next 30 years.The proposal presented at yesterday’s meeting revealed plans to construct eight new campus buildings, including three dormitories, totaling 423,836 gross square footage of space. The university also wants to include training facilities for their track and field team.The 30-year master plan was first shown to the East Falls Community Council in April 2015. As was the case at that time, local residents voiced their concerns to the Civic Design Review committee yesterday about the development’s proximity to the Wissahickon Watershed.The Wissahickon Watershed overlay states that due to development’s ability to cause flooding and erosion, ""it is necessary to impose environmental controls to protect the health, safety and general welfare, to improve water quality and to achieve environmentally sound land development within the Wissahickon Watershed.""Committee member and architect Cecil Baker later said, ""It’s clear that this is a sensitive part of the city. [...] I would feel much better if I saw plans that were broader and at least showed the watershed surrounding this area.""In addition to environmental concerns, some locals also pointed to Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University’s recent merger announcement. One resident argued that the lack of public details on the integration since the December announcement make it premature for the CDR to act on the design proposal for the master plan.The committee ultimately voted 5-3 in favor of concluding the Civic Design Review process for the university’s master plan, though some members urged the design team to incorporate more green space into the proposal.

It will include 20 residential units and seven bike spaces.The developers have not officially settled on the property yet, so it’s not clear who the new owners will be. But when it first listed for sale in 2015, Property reported that some ""heavy hitters"" were actively interested in the showroom, given its prominent location and history.Called Overseas Motor Works, the Art Deco building stands out along Fairmount Avenue, thanks to its two-story tower and architectural significance. It’s not far from the adaptive-reuse project AF Bornot Dye Factory Works, which was converted into apartments and single-family homes, and just down the street from the Divine Lorraine Hotel.The application goes to the ZBA on Tuesday, June 21 at 9:30 a.m."

Indeed, things are looking good at 1128 Chestnut, the future site of the city’s first ""flexible format"" Target.Here’s what the site looked like yesterday:PhillyMag reported in May that the official opening date is July 20. The 19,000-square-foot store is part of a mixed-use development by Brickstone that will include 112 high-end apartments and a CVS and Starbucks.The second Center City Target location at the former Boyd Theater site is scheduled to open later this month, too."

The bills now go to city council for final approval.PlanPhilly reports that at yesterday's meeting, the committee unanimously approved a bill that will rezone the 3.36-acre parcel from I-2 medium industrial to CMX3. The other bill proposal modifies an overlay, which will allow the development to include drinking and eating establishments, non-accessory parking, and increased the occupied area.Lincoln Square has received a good bit of community support since the developers announced their plans for the nine-story apartment building with retail this past March.When Curbed Philly spoke with Steve Gendler of MIS Capital then, he said the goal is to present to the Civic Design Review mid-summer."
L&I: No Move-Ins at One Water Street ,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/6/7/11875230/one-water-street-affordable-housing-deal,article,"The residential high-rise at One Water Street on the Delaware River waterfront is pretty much move-in ready. But future residents won't be able to move in until the developers do as they promised back in 2014: Include 25 affordable units.So what's the hold up? PMC Property Group apparently wants out of the affordable housing deal they made with the city, which allowed them to receive a density bonus to build the high-rise 48-feet taller than is normally allowed by zoning, as long as they included affordable housing units.The request to duck out of the deal means that the developers have to go back to zoning and request another variance for their now too-tall building.That's not going happen, if the Department of Licenses and Inspections has anything to do with it. The L&I plans to withhold the certificate for occupancy from the developers unless they deliver on their deal to include the 25 below-market rate units, PlanPhilly reported yesterday.There are some other ways that PMC Property Group could appease the city. Philadelphia Inquirer's architecture critic Inga Saffron wrote:Seeking to clarify the city's position, David Perri, who heads the Department of Licenses and Inspections, said Monday that PMC would be excused from the low-income housing deal only if it could provide other amenities of equal value to compensate for the 48-foot height bonus. Under the waterfront zoning rules, PMC could potentially gain 24 feet for ground-floor retail and 12 feet for public art.The developers have remained mum on why they made such a last-minute request.The Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations wrote a letter to Mayor Jim Kenney yesterday that urged him to hold PMC Property Group accountable.

Independence Visitor Center to Undergo $15M Reno,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/6/6/11852376/independence-visitor-center-renovations-renderings,article,"It's been 15 years since the Independence Visitor Center opened its doors at Market and 6th streets as part of Independence National Historical Park's master plan. And president and CEO Jim Cuorato knows it's time for a change.After four years of planning, the most-visited venue in Southeastern Pennsylvania is about to undergo a $15 million renovation that will include a new upper-level terrace, a bigger gift shop, new bathrooms, and more welcoming, well, welcome desks.""So much has changed in the last 15 years,"" says Cuorato. ""We wanted to update the building and give it a more modern feel, keeping in mind we are in a historical district.He adds, ""But most importantly, we want to enhance the visitors' experience by giving them information in different ways.""That includes new touch-screens that will line a wall, allowing visitors to plan their stay in Philadelphia and download their agenda onto their smartphones. For those still looking for that personal interaction with the multilingual staff, they'll be nearby at a new welcome desk.In addition, the second movie theater will be enclosed by a glass wall and feature a 7- to 10-minute orientation video to the city.""The idea is to get people excited about being here,"" says Cuorato.But one of the biggest renovations will involve the gift shop. It's currently located at the entrance off Market and 6th Street. But as the biggest source of revenue for Independence Visitor Center, it's also the most cramped.""During our busiest times in the summer, it's literally elbow-to-elbow in here,"" says Cuorato. ""It's not a pleasant browsing experience.""The plan is to expand the gift shop by 50 percent. In order to do that, the bathrooms will move to the right side of the building that faces the mall.We want to enhance the visitors' experience by giving them information in different waysThe redesign will also aim to encourage visitors to walk up to the new welcome desks from the Market and 6th Street entrance, via digital screens that will line the walls.""When people come in, they see the gift shop and restroom, but they don’t know what’s up there,"" Cuorato says, pointing toward the welcome desks. ""So one of the things we wanted to do is make it generally pull people into the building and let them know that good information is up ahead.""At the other end of the building, the sightseeing tours will be lined up in a more coherent fashion and the grab-and-go food stations will move to the very end. Visitors will also be able to sit and work out their travel schedules in a new Trip Planning station. Currently, tourists tend to sit on the floors or stairs while planning their travel agenda, says Cuorato.In total, the renovation is expected to cost $15 million and is being designed by local architects SaylorGregg, the same firm behind the Franklin Institute's recent renovations.The Independence Visitor, which is owned by the National Parks Service but managed by a 501c3 non-profit organization, has raised $2 million to date. It also has an application in for a $3.2 million grant from the Redevelopment Assistant Capital Program.

If all goes to plan, Cuorato says construction bids should begin in July.

Philadelphia Met Opera House Renderings Revealed,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/6/3/11850510/philadelphia-metropolitan-opera-house-renderings,article,"Last month we offered readers an inside tour of the long-abandoned Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House, the historic big box of a building that sits on North Broad Street.And yesterday, Chris Cordaro of EB Realty Management shared these renderings of the opera house on Curbed Philly's Facebook page. No, the renderings don't reveal much, except plans for the box office on the right corner and a restaurant on the left. And given the building's historic stature, the facade will be restored and remain in tact.As of mid-May, developer Eric Blumenfeld and funder Billy Procida said they were close to finalizing a main tenant for the opera house. They described it as one of the ""nation's biggest concert promoters"" and said they'd make an announcement in three to six months, if all goes to plan.We reached out to EB Realty Management and CBRE, who is handling the retail aspect of the property, for a comment. We'll update when we know more.Until now, take a tour of the historic opera house as it stands today.

The Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House












              The Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera house sits at 858 North Broad Street.
            








              It was designed by architect William H. McElfatrick for Oscar Hammerstein I, the grandfather of Oscar Hammerstein II.
            








              Most recently, the opera house served as the headquarters for the Holy Ghost Headquarters Revival Center.
            








              Today, developer Eric Blumenfeld owns partial stake in the property and is planning a $35 million renovation.
            








              The seating has been stripped, though when it was built in 1908 it sat some 4,000 people, making it the largest theater in the world at the time.
            








              Developer Blumenfeld says they will reveal the new tenant of the opera house in a few months.
            








              ""A lot of it is preservable, but a lot of it is already gone,"" Blumenfeld said on a recent tour.
            








              The opera house began to fall into disrepair during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was poised for demolition until the church rallied to save the property.
            








              The theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

The Piazza in Northern Liberties Has a New Name,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/6/1/11827526/piazza-northern-liberties-rebranding-campaign,article,"Don't call it the Piazza. The mixed-use development that rose up in Northern Liberties in 2009 to great success and has since struggled to retain tenants is going by a new name: The Schmidt's Commons.It's all part of Kushner Companies' goal to rebrand the development, which it bought from developer Bart Blatstein in 2013. Since then, the Schmidt's Commons has seen a long list of retail and restaurant tenants come and ago, including PYT and King's Oaks.A recent visit to the actual Piazza at Schmidt's Commons revealed empty tables, and the rare patron walking in and out of the surrounding retail. It's been a common sight over the years, and one that Kushner is hoping to change starting today, with the opening of WeWork at the former Schmidt's Brewery.""We’re diving into a new phase with commercial folks like WeWork and Landmark [Americana] coming in,"" says Sean Gavin, Community Manager at The Schmidt’s Commons. ""It felt right to transition and dive into this property and revitalize it.""The rebranding campaign involves more than a change in names. Kushner says they've hired an events coordinator for the first time, and have released a new summer lineup for the Piazza at Schmidt's Commons that includes salsa night, a free Philadelphia Orchestra concert, and movie nights.This is all after Kushner was criticized in recent years for its lack of communication with local neighborhood associations and their own residents—there are 500 apartment units total in the development.""We’re working with the neighborhood and listening to what our residents want and really implementing events that make sense,"" says Gavin.They're also looking to Spruce Street Harbor Park for some design inspiration, and are adding modular furniture to the piazza, as well as more signage along 2nd Street to encourage more people to visit.""The whole point and purpose is for residents and the community to use it as a live-work-play space,"" says Gavin. "" It’s a new chapter here."""
Inside Philly's First WeWork in Northern Liberties,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/6/1/11818910/photos-wework-philadelphia-office-tour,article,"Today marks the opening of Philly's first-ever WeWork, a co-working office space that has made its rounds to 28 cities around the world since first opening in 2010.WeWork has taken up residence at the former Schmidt's Brewery in Northern Liberties and features 30,000 square feet of offices, both private and open, and plenty of entertaining spaces to spare—not to mention three kegs, stadium stair-seating, and gourmet kitchens to boot.""A bunch of our team is from Philadelphia to begin with, so this city has always been on our mind,"" said Dave McLaughlin, general manager of Eastern US and Canada during a recent tour of WeWork. ""Northern Liberties just felt like a part of town that has all of this great stuff percolating.""Curbed Philly toured the space at the 11th hour, just as construction crews and the design team were finishing up last-minute decorations and installing signage. As with all location, this WeWork was designed by the company's in-house team of 140 architects and decorators.But there are architectural details and spaces unique to this specific location. ""This is an interesting one because we allocated a greater space to event space,"" says McLaughlin. ""We felt like one of the ways we could really contribute to what’s happening in Northern Liberties and Philadelphia's innovation community is to have spaces where they could really come together.""On the second level there's a large catering kitchen, plus a bar with three kegs, a game room, and a lounging area. Much of the former factory's raw industrial details remain—there's an old kiln where malt was brewed and large metal sliding doors throughout—but the designers have also incorporated warm colors, furniture, and rugs to warm up the space.To date, WeWork is currently half booked, with members that include MeetMe and City Fitness, and they expect to be fully-booked in a couple of months. Says Kelly Burgart, Philadelphia City Lead for WeWork, ""There's a pretty dynamic mix of people.""McLaughlin adds, ""If we can understand a city and bring offerings that matches with city’s strengths and what it needs, that makes it a more fun and energetic place.""Another WeWork location is scheduled to open this fall at 1430 Walnut Street.

Design Committee Approves Ridge Flats Proposal,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/6/1/11822316/east-falls-ridge-flats-design-approved,article,"The Civic Design Review committee voted to conclude the CDR process for a large, mixed-use development proposed for East Falls, though not without making list of suggestions for the project.The one and only project presented to the Civic Design Review committee at yesterday's monthly meeting was 4300-4325 Ridge Avenue, dubbed ""Ridge Flats."" Developer Grasso Holdings architects Morris Adjmi/Onion Flats Architecture are behind the development, which will sit on a 1.7-acre lot and include 206 residential units—20 percent of which will come furnished—and 20,188 square feet of commercial space.It's not the first time Grasso Holdings has come to the Civic Design Review. It presented previous plans to the CDR about three years ago. Given the committee's suggestion to change the main access point of the building, ""by virtue of that we had to redesign it entirely because of the way it affected parking,"" developer David Grasso said at the beginning of the presentation.""So here we are with version 2.0,"" Grasso said.The architects revealed renderings that features a 236,084-square-foot building that is designed to look like it's backing away from Kelly Drive and gesturing toward the Schuylkill River. In addition, there's a proposed green wall along the Kelly Drive side, which will incorporate a living art installation as part of the Percent for Art Program.The design committee applauded the proposal and its efforts to activate a long-vacant space in a highly-trafficked area. But among the chief complaints of the committee was the ""monolithic wall"" proposed along Ridge Avenue.Committee chair Nancy Rogo Trainer said, ""It makes the building seem a little relentless. It would be terrific if there was some way of breaking up what could be a very monotonous building.""Some suggestions from the committee were to incorporate more public spaces along with the ground-floor retail on Ridge Avenue. Simply adding more color variation to the paneling could help, too, they said.Aside from design, Grasso said he is in talks with three grocery store retailers for the ground-floor commercial space, as well as a restaurant-cafe along Kelly Drive. He's also considering turning some of the space into offices.With the vote to conclude the CDR process, the project now goes to the Zoning Board of Appeals and the City Planning Commission."
Are the Police Still Moving to West Philly?,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/5/31/11818166/philly-police-headquarters-inquirer-building,article,"Well this is an interesting development: The Kenney administration is currently reevaluating moving its police headquarters to 4601 Market Street.According to Philly Mag, the administration may have its eye on moving the police to the old Inquirer building at 400 N. Broad Street instead. In a statement, a spokesperson for Mayor Jim Kenney would not comment on the Bart Blatstein-owned building, but did say they were reviewing multiple options.The news comes after we checked in on the construction progress at 4601 Market Street last week. The master plan for the Public Safety Services Campus involves moving the police, the medical examiner's office and morgue, and the Department of Health Laboratory Services over to the Provident Mutual Life Building in West Philly.Regardless of what happens, both sites would be welcome additions to West Philly and North Broad. Currently, 4601 Market sits on a corner that faces a vacant lot to its left, an Aldi grocery store across the street, and the 46th and Market El station. The Inquirer building sits in the hub of revitalization efforts happening up and down North Broad."

It will include 500 patient rooms, an ER department, and a parking garage.The plans were approved ahead of the Civic Design Review (CDR). When questioned by design committee chair Nancy Rogo Trainer why the plans were being presented without the committee's input, presenter Martin Gregorski said they were waiting until final plans were approved by Penn before bringing it to the CDR.A spokesperson for Penn told the Philadelphia Inquirer that those plans are still ""in the early stages."""

Today, it's just a big white box on the corner of North Broad and Poplar, with vegetation peaking out of boarded up windows.But that's where the similarities between the two hulking buildings ends. The Divine Lorraine has long captured the hearts of Philadelphians and out-of-towners alike, its graffiti-laden exterior and interiors doubling as almost an ode to what was once an extravagant hotel and worship house.

 The opera house? On a recent visit to the theater, a passerby said, ""This is the first time I've ever noticed that building."" A week later, another man said, ""Is someone actually doing something with this building? What is it?""The Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House was built in 1908 by Oscar Hammerstein I, the grandfather of Oscar Hammerstein II. Designed by architect William H. McElfatrick, it sat some 4,000 people, becoming the largest theater of its kind in the world. After some time Hammerstein I fell into debt and sold the property, which then went through a number of owners. Over the years it's served as a movie theater, circus venue, ballroom, and most recently, a church.Today, it's now in the hands of Eric Blumenfeld, the same developer who is behind the ongoing $44 million restoration of the Divine Lorraine just three blocks away.In 2013, Blumenfeld and the Holy Ghost Headquarters Church bought the historic theater in 2013 for a buck. The church has since vacated the property, and Blumenfeld says that soon, people can expect to see some life at the long-forgotten theater of the Gilded Age.In three to six months, he'll reveal the new tenant for the theater's, well, sixth chance. On a recent tour of the property, all funding partner Billy Procida would say was that it will be one of the ""nation's biggest concert promoters.""""This is going to be one of the coolest rock, theatrical venues in the country,"" Blumenfeld said.

Both the exterior and interior show the building's age. Standing on the wide stage looking out to the stadium seating, Blumenfeld said, ""This is the part of the tour when people tell me, 'You're crazy.'""While much of the interiors are preservable, a lot of it—namely the seating—has already been lost, he says. After they announce the tenant, Blumenfeld expects the theater to go through a year-long, $35 million renovation. His hope is that the re-opening of the theater will be the key to North Broad's revitalization.Until then, take a tour of the grand theater as it stands today.

              It was designed by architect William H. McElfatrick for Oscar Hammerstein I, the grandfather of Oscar Hammerstein II.
            








              Most recently, the opera house served as the headquarters for the Holy Ghost Headquarters Revival Center.
            








              Today, developer Eric Blumenfeld owns partial stake in the property and is planning a $35 million renovation.
            








              The seating has been stripped, though when it was built in 1908 it sat some 4,000 people, making it the largest theater in the world at the time.
            








              Developer Blumenfeld says they will reveal the new tenant of the opera house in a few months.
            








              ""A lot of it is preservable, but a lot of it is already gone,"" Blumenfeld said on a recent tour.
            








              The opera house began to fall into disrepair during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was poised for demolition until the church rallied to save the property.
            








              The theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
            








              Looking toward the ornate doors from the theater.
            








              The building was built in 1908 and sits on the corner of North Broad and Poplar Street.

You Can Pre-Lease a Divine Lorraine Apartment Now,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/4/29/11539772/divine-lorraine-apartments-prelease,article,"Good news about the Divine Lorraine just keeps coming: The apartments are now available for pre-leasing.Last week while on a tour of the historic hotel we learned that the apartments would be complete by the end of the year. And yesterday, a Craigslist ad was posted advertising a pre-leasing special for 1- and 2-bedroom units.We reached out to the folks at EB Realty and they confirmed to Curbed Philly that this is not a drill. Regional property manager Ed Casella said, ""The ninth floor is the first floor we're rolling out. The floors are in, the tile is laid out, and the granite will be installed within a couple of weeks.""Casella did clarify, however, that while they're a week ahead of schedule, the apartments won't be ready until between November and January. ""We're tracking nicely at this point,"" he said.Here's what we can expect so far in terms of finishes and amenities:One-bedroom units will start at $1,325 and two-bedrooms will start at $2,540. For the pre-leasing special, the second month is free on all two-bedroom units.""We think they’re priced very appropriately and competitively with a lot of our other projects on the North Broad corridor and we have the added value of being in the Divine Lorraine Hotel,"" said Casella. ""It's really just a labor of love for us—the fact that it's actually happening adds a cherry on top for us."""

The retail and restaurant space is expected to follow after.Members of the Urban Land Institute were given a tour of the hotel yesterday as part of the Urban Land Institute Spring Meeting by developer Eric Blumenfeld, who took on the restoration project in 2014 after the historic property suffered years of neglect and stood as a visual sign of decay on North Broad Street.""This project is different from anything we've done so far,"" said Blumenfeld, who is behind a number of North Broad Street redevelopment projects, including the Mural Arts Loft and 640 and 600 North Broad.As we reported before, Blumenfeld said that the Divine Lorraine will include two restaurants, one on the first floor with the grand lobby and reception area, and the second in the annex building that connects to the hotel via an underground passage. One restaurant will be similar to the Spotted Pig in New York City's West Village, Blumenfeld said. There will also be a speakeasy in the basement.Blumenfeld said that the restoration of the 10-story building began on the ninth floor, followed by the 10th floor. They're both nearly finished, though windows still need to be installed.

New Lincoln Square Renderings Revealed,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/4/15/11437552/new-lincoln-square-renderings-revealed,article,"Last March we learned that yet another mixed-use development named Lincoln Square was in the works for South Broad and Washington, directly across the street from Bart Blatstein's proposed mega-project.But the location is the only thing the two projects have in common. Unlike Blatstein's proposed 32-story tower and 1,800,000-square-foot development at 1001 S. Broad Street, the Lincoln Square project plans for an 9-story apartment building and retail on the ground floor.Another glaring difference: Residents are actually in support of Lincoln Square.The developers, Alterra and MIS Capital, met earlier this week with residents for an informational session on their proposed project and revealed new renderings. According to reports, it went over pretty well.MIS Capital sent Curbed Philly the preliminary renderings, which reveal a new color scheme for the apartment building, which will include 356 units. Also in the proposal is a roof terrace with views of the skyline and three levels of parking (one underground).Another rendering features the historic train shed, which served as a major hub for the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Baltimore Railroad line and a funeral stop of President Abraham Lincoln after his assassination. The plan is to repurpose it for retail.Of course, this is all subject to change. Though he wouldn't go into specifics, Steve Gendler of MIS Capital says, ""These are still very preliminary and lack critical details that we are already working on.""As the design stands now, Philadelphia Inquirer's architecture critic Inga Saffron suspects that Lincoln Square won't run into much criticism from the city or residents. In her latest column, she writes, ""The mixed-use development on the west side of Broad and Washington isn't perfect, but it is likely to sail through the planning reviews.""She, too, compares Lincoln Square to Blatstein's, pointing out that the former will be wrapped with ground-floor shops, while the latter's proposed European retail village will be on the fourth level. The first three levels will be dedicated to a parking garage that dictates the layout and ""is a disaster in the making.""Still, Blatstein, whose project is about two years in the making, has already concluded the design review process and will go to the zoning board later this month, where Saffron suspects it will likely get the green light to forge ahead, despite the critiques.The Lincoln Square development is still in the beginning stages of the planning process and expects to go to the Civic Design Review later this year."
Design Advocacy Group's Open Letter to Blatstein,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/4/11/11410230/design-advocacy-group-critiques-bart-blatstein-projects,article,"There's no doubt about it: Bart Blatstein is a contentious fellow in Philadelphia right about now. The developer has proposed two significant developments in South Philly, including a superblock project at South Broad and Washington Avenue and another project along the Delaware River Waterfront.And many people have their problems with both. Since February a petition has been circulating protesting the Delaware waterfront project. And at a recent Civic Design Review meeting, the committee called Blatstein's designs ""perfunctory"" at best and suggested he go back to the drawing board.Now, the Design Advocacy Group of Philadelphia, a volunteer organization that promotes public discussion about design, has entered the debate by voicing their concerns with the projects in a commentary article for the Philadelphia Inquirer. Here's what they had to say about the South Broad Street project, which the group calls ""stunningly overbuilt"" and ""outdated"":From every vantage point, its huge, lifeless facades would create vast and forbidding street-level walls, ignoring the modern public's sensible preference for walkable streets with varied and engaging street frontages. [...]An especially curious aspect of the project is its rooftop village, ""reminiscent of a village in Provence,"" Blatstein says. [...]  Besides the questionable business viability of this weird location, why is it accessible, even in Tower's second design iteration, only at Washington and 13th, this time with an open stairwell?As for the waterfront plans, which call for a suburban-like development with a strip mall, the Design Advocacy Group asks, ""Do we really need another convenience store on Columbus Boulevard?Whether Blatstein responds to the critiques remain to be seen, though based on past history, he probably will. Remember his letter to the Inquirer in which he said architecture critic Inga Saffron was living in a ""fantasy land?""You can read the full commentary by the Design Advocacy Group here."

Broad Street did address some of the advisory committee's suggestions from the March meeting. In particular, it included a new ""grand"" staircase leading to the fourth-floor European-style retail village. It also slightly shifted the proposed building on Broad and Carpenter by 60 feet.Still, the new proposal did not address the height of the 32-story tower, which is the most-contested part of the project among residents. One resident of the Hawthorne neighborhood who lives across the street said, ""We don't want a 32-story tower. Where I live, I will be looking out to a total wall.""Albert Hicks, another Hawthorne resident who has met with Blatstein multiple times, pointed to a number of other developments along South Broad Street that have remained in the five- to eight-story range, including Carl Dranoff's 777 South Broad project.Committee chair Nancy Rogo Trainer said, ""It still feels like a wall between South Philly and Center City,"" adding that he should consider going back to the drawing board.Given that it is Blatstein's second presentation to the committee, he is not required to return for another meeting.

A separate parking garage would be built on an existing parking lot to accommodate the dormitory.A representative for the University of Sciences told Curbed Philly that they weren't ready to release renderings to the public yet, as they plan to incorporate some of the suggestions from neighbors and community stakeholders into the design.University of Sciences bought the school in 2014 for about $1 million. The Alexander Wilson Public School was one of about two dozen schools that were shuttered by the district in 2013.Design Collective is no stranger to Philly.

Sneak Peak: One West Condos in Chestnut Hill,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/29/11319832/one-west-condos-chestnut-hill,article,"Chestnut Hill is a neighborhood that appears trapped in time. Its boutique-strewn shopping strip along Germantown Avenue is lined with mom-and-pop shops. The yards of homes along picturesque residential streets are impeccably manicured. Even the neighborhood playground still has a wooden swing set.But to say that Chestnut Hill has remain largely unchanged in recent years would be to ignore One West, a new residential development that sits smack dab in the middle of Germantown Avenue's shopping district.Actually, go ahead and ignore it—that's kind of the whole point.The $35 million project is a mixed-use development spearheaded by Chestnut Hill resident and developer Richard Snowden. The project's history goes back to 2008, when the property, a former car dealership, became available at the height of the housing bust.Today, the two-acre site features a five-story building with 20 luxury condos and ground floor retail. Its main tenant: Fresh Market, a national grocery store.It was a rare move for a neighborhood that prides itself on local businesses, nine of which are more than 50 years old. (For a prime example, look no further than the cat clinic next door to Fresh Market—it sits in the Detwiler House, the oldest building in Chestnut Hill that dates back to 1744.)As Snowden puts it, ""I didn't want One West to be splashy. I really stressed to the designers that it had to be a quiet, good neighbor.""Snowden hired SPG3 architects, a local firm that designed Whole Foods on South Street. The end result: A mostly brick structure with some classic Chestnut Hill details mixed in, including Wissahickon shist stone, expansive terraces on every level, floor-to-ceiling windows, and French doors. Snowden went so far as to choose dark green exterior finishes to make the building appear to recede from the street.""We wanted to make the building seem as small as possible,"" Snowden said.For its size and location—it sits right in the middle of Germantown Avenue—One West surprisingly fits in well for traditionally quaint neighborhood. As Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron noted, ""One West demonstrates that a large apartment building doesn't have to be overbearing.""Still, the development didn't come without critics. When Snowden initially proposed the project in 2011, petitions circulated opposing its construction. Snowden, who lives just a few blocks from One West, met with community members multiple times to make changes to the project to appease its neighbors.""I believe in the process and expected to be grilled just like anybody else,"" Snowden said. ""It's why this neighborhood has stayed the way it is.""The interior finishes of the condos, which range from $875,000 to $2.5 million, will stay true to Chestnut Hill style, too. Buyers can opt for what Snowden calls the conservative package, which includes hardwood floors and original millwork.All of the condos are still under construction, though a tour of the property revealed expansive views of the neighborhood from the terraces—one of the largest patios is 1,800 square feet alone and has a small pool.Five of the 20 condos have been bought. Snowden says most of the interested tenants are in the 55-75 age range and are looking to downsize and ""have a little bit of fun."" It's a similar trend that Center City is experiencing, with empty nesters moving from the suburbs to the city's luxury condos.Just don't expect any amenities at One West. Says Snowden, ""Chestnut Hill is the amenity.""

""The completion date will be in about 18 months, so May or June 2017,"" he says.Also linked to the project are 12 townhouses. Yeager says construction on these will occur after the tower is complete.When complete in 2017, View32 will be just a block from the site of Schuylkill Yards, Drexel University's $3.5 billion innovation neighborhood. Yeager says that while his project is separate from Schuylkill Yards, he's looking forward to being adjacent to the new neighborhood. ""It's exciting news for us, too.""

A Helpful Timeline of the 30th St. Station District Plan,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/16/11244554/30th-st-station-district-plan-timeline,article,"We know: There is a lot in store for University City, from Drexel University's ambitious Schuylkill Yards innovation neighborhood to the 30th St. Station District Plan. With the recent release of the district plan's fourth draft with renderings galore to boot, we all have one question: When will all of this actually be built?Here's your answer. The current draft of the 30th St. Station District Plan included a timeline of their proposed project, which we've outlined here.

New Renderings Emerge of 30th St. Station Plan,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/15/11236398/30th-st-station-district-plan-renderings,article,"The fourth draft of the 30th Street District Plan has been released to the public ahead of tomorrow's open house at 30th Street Station, and there are renderings galore to go over. And so you don't have to read through the 30-page document (although, you can here if you so desire), we pulled eight important developments on the ambitious project that you need to know.1. Improvements to 30th Street Station will likely happen first.In a effort to increase accessibility to the train station, the plan proposes a number of upgrades: Access on all four sides of the building and reopening the North Concourse to increase platform access to Amtrak by 50 percent. The report says these improvements should be ""achievable in the near term.""2. Megabus and Bolt will actually have a real bus stop.Right now, these bus stops are located across the street from the station along a sidewalk. The new plan proposes to move the stops to the north side of Arch Street—one of the new entrances to the station. The bus stop will be covered, and be connected via pedestrian bridge to the station.3. Commuters won't have to go outside to transfer to SEPTA. In the new proposal, commuters transferring to SEPTA from Amtrak will be able to reach the subway or trolley via a new stairway in the Main Hall of 30th St. Station. The concourse will have a massive skylight and retail.4. There will be more green space—lots of it.The new plan proposes Station Plaza, a civic space designed to be a gateway to University City and Drexel's proposed Schuylkill Yards. The Porch, already installed at 30th St. Station, will be expanded, and there will be pockets of green spaces all around the station. There's also a proposal to built a park underneath the highline that connects South Street bridge to Penn Park.5. The new neighborhood above the rail yards is still an option.In the last public comment periods, most folks were in favor of capping the rail yards at 30th St. Station, though one version called Innovation City proved to be the least promising. The fourth draft still proposes building a new neighborhood above the rail yards, 10 million square feet of development to be exact. It also proposes 8 million square feet of development adjacent to the station.6. A large park called ""Schuylkill Bluffs"" is proposed for above the tracks.The plan calls for another park along the eastern edge of the rail yards. Dubbed Schuylkill Bluffs, it'll sit above the Northeast Corridor tracks, and serve as another connection to the river and extra green space for the surrounding neighborhoods.7. Pedestrian bridges are still in the works, too.As a way to promote easier access to and from Center City, the plan proposes creating two pedestrian- and bike-only bridges across the Schuylkill River, including one at Race Street. Another pedestrian-and-car bridge is proposed from Powelton Village to Center City.8. Yes, you absolutely have a say in all of this.This is the fourth version of this $5.25 million study. The public has the opportunity to weigh in on these revised plans tomorrow, March 16 at the 30th Street Station Open House from 4 to 7 PM. A fifth and final draft will be presented this summer."
Another Mixed-Use Project Coming to South and Broad,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/15/11225410/-100m-lincoln-square-development-proposed-for-broad-and-washington,article,"Another mixed-use development project is in the works for the northwest corner of South Broad and Washington, directly across from Bart Blatstein's proposed mega-development.The project, called Lincoln Square, will be developed by Alterra Property Group and MIS Capital, LLC. It calls for an 8-story, 356-unit apartment building and 74,000 square feet of retail at 1000-20 S. Broad Street. There will also be a parking garage with 360 spaces.Like the Blatstein site across the street, this 3.36-acre parcel is a vacant lot. It's currently owned by the Philadelphia Authority of Industrial Development (PAID) and most recently served as a dumping ground for snow plows during winter storm Jonas. Alterra and MIS Capital are under contract to purchase the property from PAID for $6,500,000.Steve Gendler of MIS Capital, LLC tells Curbed Philly that the estimated cost of the project will be $100 million.Also on the property is a historic train shed, which is famous for being the site of a  major hub for the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Baltimore Railroad line and a funeral stop of President Abraham Lincoln after his assassination. Hence the future development's name, Lincoln Square.The shed will be saved, as it is on the Philadelphia Historic Register and National Register of Historic Places. The plan is to repurpose it for retail, says Gendler.The developers are still in the beginning process and are continuing to meet with local neighborhood associations. ""There’s been certainly questions about details, but there's essentially no resistance from the community,"" says Gendler.That's a noticeable difference from the community reaction from Blatstein's proposed development on the northeast corner of Broad and Washington. Blatstein, who claims to have had 40-plus meetings on his project, wants to build a 34-story residential tower for the site.""We really used some of the neighborhood association's surveys as a guide to what we’re putting together,"" says Gendler. ""So we really feel like they’re kind of partners in the deal.""The next step is for the property to be rezoned to mixed-use from industrial by June, and present to the Civic Design Review by mid-summer. If all goes to plan, construction is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2017."

In a flashy press conference this afternoon held in a tent on One Drexel Plaza, Drexel University announced its 20-year plan for Schuylkill Yards, a $3.5 billion and 14-acre  project that will aim to transform West Philadelphia into a leading innovation hub of the region.Drexel president John Fry announced that Brandywine Realty Trust will be the developer of the master plan. The development company has long had a stake in University City as the developers of the Cira Center, the EVO building, and the up-and-coming FMC Tower.Fry described Schuylkill Yards as a ""new neighborhood based on innovation"" with ""world-class, open space in the tradition of the public square of Philadelphia.""The master design reveals multiple public spaces, each with their own distinct characteristics. A 1.3-acre plot—currently a parking lot at One Drexel Plaza—will become an elliptical lawn and the center of activity at Schuylkill Yards. NY-based SHOP Architects and West 8 landscape architecture firm have designed the master sites.Eight new high-rise sites will also be part of Schuylkill Yards, a mix of a laboratories, hotels, retails, residential units, and offices. NY-based Gotham Organization, Inc. will lead the residential development, and Longfellow Real Estate Partners will take on the Life Sciences component.In addition, the historic Bulletin Building, designed by architect George Howe, will undergo exterior renovations that will include a dynamic front screen along the east facade facing the elliptical green space.Brandywine Realty Trust president Jerry Sweeney said, ""This is not a corporate campus. It's a fully-engaged ecosystem.""Though the Schuylkill Yards timeline involves a 20-year buildout, it is expected to begin construction as soon as possible—starting with Drexel Park, a 1.3-acre park at 30th and Market Streets later this year.This is not a corporate campus. It will be a fully-engaged ecosystem.""We expect to deliver phase 1 several years from now,"" said Sweeney.Fry noted that they will be actively partnering with local businesses and unions, as well as maximize hiring of local residents. It's expected to create 10,000 construction jobs and 15,000 employees and residents.""This is a game changer—not just for Philadelphia,"" said state Senator Vincent Hughes. ""The innovation that happens inside Schuylkill Yards will have an impact internationally.""

Design Within Reach is Coming Back to Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/2/11145684/design-within-reach-to-join-east-market-development,article,"Rejoice, midcentury modern design lovers! After closing its doors in 2010, Design Within Reach is opening again in Philly, this time in the East Market multi-use development on Broad Street.The modern design store was formerly located on Walnut Street, but closed in 2010. Its new location will be at the corner of 11th and Ludlow streets. East Market's design calls for Ludlow Street to be lined with more artisanal shops, boutiques, and restaurants, while Market Street will be reserved for ""major thoroughfare and digital signage,"" according to the press release.NYC-based architecture firm D Form A (DFA) and Light Studio LA are behind the designs of the studio, which will be 15,000 square feet—five times the size of their former location on Walnut Street, according to DWR president John McPhee.Design Within Reach plans to open early 2017, while the first phase of East Market is expected to be complete that spring."
Townhouse Development Planned for South Kensington,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/2/11145746/south-square-development-planned-for-south-kensington,article,"Fishtown development continues to boom, but its next door neighbor South Kensington shows no signs of slowing down either. We just received word from MGC Real Estate Group that another batch of townhomes are set to break ground immediately in the burgeoning neighborhood.Yesterday AGA Developers (the same folks behind Trenton Stables and Frankford Square in Fishtown) settled a property at 182-188 W. Berks Street in South Kensington that's currently a car lot. The development, dubbed South Square, will include 17 townhomes and two triplexes, which will each have a commercial space.Each townhome will feature a driveway with two parking spaces, a roof deck, three bedrooms, and 2.5 bathrooms. They'll have 9-foot ceilings, hardwood floors, L-shaped kitchens, finished basements, and balconies off the master bedrooms.The starting price of the townhomes will be about $450,000.Leigh Calarco of MGC Real Estate Group says the Harman Deutsch-designed project will be built in four phases, with the first one scheduled to be completed in August."
Design Committee Shelves Blatstein Mega-Project,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/2/11144026/civic-design-review-bart-blatstein-south-broad-project,article,"At yesterday's nearly five-hour-long Civic Design Review meeting—a record, the committee noted—Bart Blatstein's mega-development proposed for South Broad Street and Washington Avenue was tabled, with the request that he address some of their design concerns in a follow-up meeting.The massive project is 2.5 years in the making, with Blatstein noting that yesterday's review was the 40th meeting on the development. That's not entirely surprising, given the magnitude of the 195,694-square-foot project that features a 34-story residential tower, 66,000 square feet of European-style retail on the fourth level dubbed ""The Village,"" and 620 parking spaces.The project has come under fire with local neighborhood associations, including a community meeting last week, where reportedly a majority of residents in attendance were against the mega-development. (Notably, only three local residents showed up at yesterday's design meeting.)Design committee members were most concerned with the commercial space being on the fourth floor above three parking levels. Member and local architect Cecil Baker asked, ""With this vision of a French village, the issue is, how do you get to it? Is there a way to make a way that's perceptible from the street, where things occur on the journey to the village?""Blatstein, who repeatedly throughout his presentation noted his success with the Piazza in Northern Liberties, said he would be open to designing a more transparent and transformative pathway to the Village.The design committee also suggested rearranging the tower to be aligned North-to-South in order to address shading concerns poised by residents; moving at least one level of parking below grade; and reconsidering the material that will shield the parking from the street.""This project will be a great asset—once it's done and with proper design and execution,"" said committee member Nancy Rogo Trainer.The committee also reviewed four other projects at the meeting. Here's the low-down on all of them:1950 E. Logan StreetThis mixed-use project will include 111 residential units, 2 ground-floor commercial spaces, 45 parking spaces, and 45 bike spaces. Developed by Tevel Management and designed by CKG Architects, the current site is a vacant industrial warehouse near LaSalle university.The committee's main concerns involved the building's transparency. The design calls for an 8-foot fence surrounding the property, given the ""scary"" location. The committee suggested designing a more welcoming entrance and reconsidering the tall fence in order to make it a more safe and welcoming environment.The committee voted for the developers and designers to resubmit their proposal.6501 New State RoadThis proposal is for the MaST II Community Charter School-Tacony Campus. It sits along the Delaware River and is the former site of two major industrial companies, Dodge Steel Works and Tacony Iron Works. The project includes two school buildings connected by an elevated bridge, as well as softball/baseball and soccer fields.The committee voted to conclude the design process of the project, and suggested incorporating more sustainable aspects.1222 N. 2nd StreetThis live-work residential development sits across the street from the Liberty Square development. Designed by Harman-Deustch Architecture, the proposal calls for 60-some dwelling units, 7,206-square-feet of commercial space, 10 live-work units, 56 parking spaces, and 26 bike spaces.The committee noted their concern with the project's density—92 percent of the lot will be built upon. They also noted the development's lack of landscape, commenting that the the open space proposed looked like an afterthought.They voted for the developers and design committee to resubmit their proposal.5364 Jackson StreetThis proposal will demolish the now-vacant Saint Bartholomew School and build a LifeCenter and elder care residences. Designed by Blackney Hayes Architects, the project calls for 144 residential units, a 15,000-square-foot LifeCenter, 24 parking spaces, and 14 bike spaces.The committee voted unanimously to conclude the design process for the project, which will be built in three phases.

$16M Plaza Allegheny Project is Coming to Fairhill,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/2/29/11132882/fairhill-plaza-allegheny-center-groundbreaking,article,"A large swath of land comprised of mostly junk yards is poised to become a large mixed-use, retail shopping center in the Fairhill neighborhood of North Philly. Dubbed Plaza Allegheny, construction on the nine-acre site at 400 West Allegheny Avenue will begin at tomorrow's groundbreaking ceremony, the Mayor Jim Kenney's office announced today in a press release.The $16 million Plaza Allegheny will be a 85,000-square-foot retail shopping center and bring 140 jobs to the neighborhood, which at one point was a bustling manufacturing area and home to a predominantly Latino community. As factories began to shut down, the Fairhill turned into a string of vacant lots and junk yards.According to a retail brochure for Plaza Allegheny, the center is expected to deliver in April 2016. The following retailers are currently on board: Save a Lot, Advance Auto Parts, Little Caeser's, Dunkin Donuts, and Subway.The groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. on March 1 at 3100 N. 2nd Street.

And despite running into ""some things we didn't expect""—the school experienced vandalism and theft during the demo phase—the plan is to continue construction so that the first half of apartments can be move-in ready in 2017.The update comes after the announcement earlier this month that the project received a $24 million loan. Although Bank proposed turning the 442,200-square-foot property into 268 apartments back in 2012, it took awhile for the loan to come through given that it was the developer's first Philly project.At a June 2015 meeting, Bank told Garden Court residents that the first phase of the project would include 130 apartments, followed by construction on the center and western half of the building, which will have another 150 units. Commercial space is also planned along Locust Street.A 2014 document with the City of Philadelphia's Office of Economic Opportunity reveals that the gyms and auditoriums will be rehabbed at a later phase and used for commercial space as tenants come through. It also says that resident amenities will include a gym, game room, laundry rooms, and a marketing office."

Hanover North Broad, a multi-use development on North Broad and Callowhill Streets, officially broke ground this morning.""This is going to be a first-class project,"" said Mayor Jim Kenney at the groundbreaking—his first since taking office in January.The project, which technically already began construction in December, is a joint venture between Parkway Corporation and Hanover Company. Parkway's president Robert Zuritsky began meeting with Hanover's Adam Harbin about four years ago, showing Harbin various properties throughout the city. Ultimately, Hanover chose the North Broad Street site, two corners on Broad and Callowhill Streets just north of City Hall.""It really was the site we fell in love with,"" said Harbin. ""It has the opportunity to be transformative.""The development will include two six-story apartment buildings across the street from one another, serving as a gateway to the rest of North Broad. The larger building on the southwest corner will house 229 studio, one-, and two-bedroom apartments, as well as 11,000-square-feet of retail space. The other building will include 110 units and 6,000-square-feet of retail.Both buildings will have public parking garages, bike spaces, interior courtyards, and access to a private clubhouse with a fitness center, screening room, and business center.Zuritsky, who declined to divulge the total cost of the project, said construction should be complete in 18 months."

When and why did you decide to take on this position? Well I just thought that after a pretty long career in architecture and then what felt like a equivalently long career in public life—7 years, that's like dog years!—I felt like the thing to do while I'm still coherent is try to share experience and knowledge with young people.It's kind of my last gig probably and I thought it would be really rewarding. It's also just nice being around young minds and the excitement about their future. I taught before and always liked it—so it seemed like the logical next step.You played such an integral role in the development boom during the Nutter administration. What are you most proud of accomplishing during your tenure? Well, we got some very big things done. The zoning code was rewritten, we've embarked and completed two thirds of comprehensive plan of the whole city. We got the two most difficult important projects to get done, the Divine Lorraine, and the Gallery, initiated. So they're under construction. 







Divine Lorraine. Rendering via EB Realty ManagementAnd at a kind of more business evolution level, we've had [...] quite a recovery since the recession. We've got a budding entrepreneurial community. And we've gained international status with the World Heritage City recognition—all huge things we were able to get done. I think a part of me said, ""Look this is great—get out while you can.""Now that you're not in public office, what projects are you looking forward to watching as a private citizen? Well I'm real interested in seeing the two waterfronts develop. I spent a lot of time on both of them, particularly the Delaware River. There's a lot of development to come and to make sure all the right things happen. We had developed and initiated the plan for lower Schuylkill over the next 20 years and I'm excited to see things happening there. I'll be watching those very carefully. But really, there's resurgences happening all over the city—there's certainly a ton of tower cranes.You're right. If you look at the skyline from South Street Bridge, it's just all cranes. I think it's not just the fact of the building boom. I think the entire design ethos of the city has gone up in general. I don't think every building is a winner or extraordinary piece of architecture. But I think as a whole, the design character of the city has gone up and I'm especially proud of that. 







Photo by Melissa RomeroAre there any projects that you look back now and think, ""Hey, maybe that could have gone another way""?I mean inevitably there are always some projects that I've thought, ""I missed understanding what that one was about."" But honestly there aren't that many of them. I sometimes wonder with some development projects around town whether I should have injected myself into more architectural critique. As an architect, I really felt strongly about that, but that's not my job. My job was to protect public realm. I wasn't there to be someone's architect. I tried really hard to stay focused on what our job was: to make sure buildings respond to public in the right way. 







Hill Field. Rendering by Bohlin Cywinski JacksonAs an architect, what are some of your favorite buildings in Philly? The Barnes is a spectacular building. And our institutions continue to really excel, the new dorm that's being build at Penn—Hill Field—is a very accomplished piece of architecture.Many of more developer-oriented projects, I wouldn't say they're A-plus architecture, but good solid B-pluses. With 2116 chestnut, there was a lot of negotiating with neighborhoods, working with architects on how to best position the tower. Now, it's a very handsome building. I don't think it's design award-winning, but it's a handsome urban building.Speaking of working with neighborhoods, what are your thoughts on how the civic process has changed in terms of neighborhood associations working with developers? I think the City Planning Commission staff spends a lot of time on process and working with communities. It's tortuous work, but this is important to do. We live in an era when public process and ability of people to speak about projects is enormous because of technology. Some of it is coo-coo talk, but a lot of it is really intelligent commentary.Even if you disagree and do something else, but they know you heard them, and they knew you took it seriously, that builds a better stronger community. And I think that most developers would prefer to do projects that communities around them actually like.What's your favorite neighborhood in Philly? I love East Mt. Airy, but I spent 16 years in West Philly and I still have a real place in my heart for it. I say that without being too Polyannaish about it. But we raised our children there, and we started out there.We actually were somewhat sad to move on. We started on the block as the youngest couple, and by the time we moved, everyone was having babies and growing up, and we thought hey, time to do something else."

The five-story development is nowhere near as large as the proposed Blatstein project on South Broad, but given its size of 24,373 square feet it's required to undergo the CDR process. The proposed project at 1222 N. 2nd Street, designed by Harman Deutsch Architects and being developed by Blackstone Development, consists of eight loft-style, live-work spaces on the first floor, as well as commercial space. The rest of the floors are dedicated to 78 apartments, a mix of studio, 1-, and 2-bedroom units each with their own balconies. The renderings reveal that the fourth floor will feature a green roof terrace. A parking garage with 50-plus spaces and 29 bike spaces is also included in the proposal. Currently, the property is zoned industrial, which means in addition to the CDR meeting on March 1 the project will have to be rezoned for mixed-use.

Francisville Faces New Zoning Map for 'Workforce Housing',https://philly.curbed.com/2016/2/17/11080566/francisville-zoning-map,article,"At yesterday's meeting, the City Planning Commission voted to table a zoning bill that would remap a swath of land in Francisville to allow single-family use and more workforce housing. The area in question is bound by Ridge Avenue, 16th Street, Ogden Street, 15th Street, Poplar Street, Carlisle Street, and Brown Street.The zoning bill was proposed by Council President Darrell Clarke on January 21. It's part of his efforts to bring more workforce housing to the neighborhood. A representative of his office explained that those who do not qualify for affordable housing, but can't afford the high-end housing going up in the neighborhood would essentially be eligible for workforce housing.Various residents of Francisville urged the commission to table the bill, stating that they were unaware of the proposal until last Friday. Penelope Childs, executive director of the Francisville Neighborhood Development Corporation, said, ""While we're 100 percent in support of economic diversity and creative vibrancy in this neighborhood, we don't see why this section needs to be rezoned. It is not allowing for proper community process.""An architect also involved with designing a six-parcel development in the mapped area said he was under the assumption that he was working under the original zoning map and was not aware of the proposed changes until Friday.The planning commission voted to request an extra 45 days until they take action on the bill.They also approved two zoning variances for separate projects. 1525-27 North American Street, a mixed-use project in South Kensington, and the 3675 Market Street office tower.In regards to parking with 3675 Market Street, representatives said they had worked out an agreement with the owners of two parking lots on 38th and Filbert to use 34 parking spaces. While this would be temporary, Wexford would be obligated to transfer the spots if they were to develop the parcels."
"Bok Building Plans Dog Park, Day Care, & Rooftop Restaurant",https://philly.curbed.com/2016/2/10/10959268/bok-building-rooftop-restaurant-dog-park-daycare,article,"It's been seven months and five days since Lindsey Scannapieco was handed the keys to the historic Edward W. Bok Vocational School in East Passyunk. And in that time, she and her team have hosted a rooftop pop-up bar and leased out the entire first floor to fashion designers, photographers, hat makers, even electrical engineers. Now on the Bok Building's long to-do list? Turn the pop-up bar into a permanent restaurant on the 16,000-square-foot roof, open a dog park, bring in a daycare, and begin leasing out the rest of the seven floors of the E-shaped building. All of that seems more likely after last night's East Passyunk Crossing Civic Association's zoning meeting, where residents voted 36 to 6 in favor of the Bok Building's application for a liquor license. In her presentation, Scannapieco said, ""Affordability is key for this to work. It's about balance, and having this commercial component is key."" Running the behemoth of a building isn't cheap: Utilities cost $10,000 month and the occupancy rate comes with a $1 million annual price tag. Scannapieco says the proposed 45-seat restaurant and 359-person seasonal bar is a feasible way to offset those costs and allow tenants to continue to afford the low costs. Renting a space in the building averages around $12-$13 per square foot.  







The Bok Building rents out working spaces to artists, engineers, and soon, a daycare. Photo by Michael PersicoThe community's overall support of the liquor license, however, didn't come without critiques. Various residents spoke of last summer's parking nightmares, long and loud lines on the sidewalk, and inebriated people walking the streets. Building an underground parking lot is a few years down the road, but the Scannapieco says the Bok Building has worked out an agreement with next door's Southwark school to park in its 48-space lot during restaurant hours for $10. All proceeds will go to Southwark. In addition, a 23-foot-long pull-off lane for Ubers and taxis was proposed for Mifflin Street, to help eliminate traffic congestion. There will also be a 20-person line limit outside of the building—local residents in the 19147 and 19148 zip codes will be able to skip the line entirely. The liquor license can still be appealed, but if all goes to plan, the restaurant will open in June.

Wineberg also presented two potential options of the residential tower, one at 599 feet and the other at 549 feet. Lowering the building to 549 feet causes the building to become slightly longer toward Sansom. ""We feel that does not benefit Sansom Street,"" Wineberg said.

At the meeting, Tiffany Green of the Concerned Citizens of Point Breeze reiterated to the commission that the neighborhood had voted against the housing project at a recent community meeting. Their main concern: They want a business development that will create jobs, such as a grocery store, and not a residential community that will increase housing and rental prices in the up-and-coming neighborhood.

Hernandez commented that while they'd be happy to continue discussions, it wasn't likely that a compromise could be reached.

According to a column published in the Philadelphia Inquirer yesterday, the project has already raised $5.1 million of the $9.6 million needed to begin construction. The problem? The other $3.5 million they're waiting on is from the state's Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program, which is held up in the state budget. Perhaps that's why the CCD announced today that the Bacon Brothers (of Philly natives Michael and actor Kevin Bacon) will be hosting a special benefit concert this February at Union Transfer to raise funds for the Viaduct Rail Park.

$10M Study Announced to Cover I-95 Around Penn's Landing,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/1/4/10850058/penns-landing-study-capping-i95-announcement,article,"In his last press conference last week, outgoing Mayor Michael Nutter announced a $10 million study to cover a portion of I-95 along the Delaware River waterfront. The study, funded by the state and federal government, will focus on potentially capping the area around Penn's Landing, including the interstate and Columbus Boulevard between Chestnut and Walnut streets. Currently, pedestrians have to walk over the interstate via the South Street Pedestrian Bridge from Old City to Penn's Landing. In his farewell address, Nutter said, """"I think everybody has recognized, in the whole scheme of things, replacement of I-95 and the damage that its done to this city and a number of others is pretty clear.""

The potential capping is part of a master plan for the Central Delaware River Waterfront that's been in the works for years now. In April 2014, the Delaware River Waterfront Corporation released a general concept plan that included the capping, as well as an 11-acre park, extending the South Street Pedestrian Bridge, and a multi-use trail to connect Penn's Landing to Philly neighborhoods. The total estimated cost of the project is estimated to be $250 million, and is expected to bring in $1.6 billion in revenue.According to NBC10, there is no official timeline for the $10 million study.·In Final News Conference as Philly Mayor, Michael Nutter Says He Wants to Bury 95[NBC10]·2014 Penn's Landing Feasibility Study [DRWC]"

At least, that's what they're saying for now. First African Baptist Church was recently added to the city's register of historic places, despite protests from the church's Reverend Terrence D. Griffith. Initial plans were to sell the property and convert it into condos. But a group of congregants worked with architectural historian Oscar Beisert on an application to add the church to the city's register of historic places. The church, located at the southwest corner of 16th and Christian, was constructed in 1906 and designed by Watson & Huckel.

What You Need to Know About the Philadelphia Land Bank,https://philly.curbed.com/2015/12/10/9892464/philadelphia-land-bank-what-you-need-to-know,article,"The Philadelphia Land Bank officially opened for business yesterday when it gained its first 150 properties from the Philadelphia Housing Development Corp. And it was a longtime coming: the Land Bank was created in 2013 as a way to streamline the sales of vacant, tax-delinquent city properties to private developers, according to the Philly Voice. At the press conference yesterday, Mayor Michael Nutter said, ""We would have liked to have had this about a decade ago."" But what exactly does this all mean for the 8,700 public-owned vacant properties in Philly? We put together a little Q&A to help you out. What exactly is the Philadelphia Land Bank?It's essentially a tool that simplifies the process of transferring city-owned properties to private owners. It also has the ability to foreclose privately-owned vacant properties that could potentially be used to revitalize a neighborhood. The Land Bank is run by a board of real estate, development, and public policy professionals. Why did Philly create the Land Bank? Because the current system was complicated. Interested owners in publicly-owned vacant properties essentially had to jump through hoops to buy land and apply through various agencies. Now, private buyers can go to one source to find and purchase properties. So it's basically a real estate listing website? Kind of. Most of the properties you'll find via the Land Bank are either vacant or the buildings need significant repairs. And they're still working on showing what properties actually look like. For now, you can use their map of properties and check out the street view, prices, size, and zoning. How many properties are currently in the Land Bank? Yesterday the Land Bank received 150 properties from the Philadelphia Housing Development Corp, and 650 more properties are expected to follow by the end of the year. City Council also plans to transfer 833 city-owned properties to the Land Bank. So will the Land Bank eventually receive all 8,700 vacant properties in Philly?In an ideal world, yes. But one of the critiques of the Philadelphia Land Bank is that district Council members can veto land transfers in their section of the city, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. ·Philadelphia Land Bank [Official]·Philadelphia Land Bank gains first properties [PV]·Phila.

"Navy Yard is Booming, so When Can People Live There?",https://philly.curbed.com/2015/12/1/9895736/navy-yard-residential-units-plan,article,"There's no doubt about it: Navy Yard's 1,200-acre campus is where the cool kids work, what with its jogging and walking paths, public green spaces, and mix of restored historic lofts and modern office buildings. About 12,000 employees currently occupy the 7.5 million square feet of real estate that's in development, including hipster haven Urban Outfitters and Marc Vetri's restaurant Lo Spiedo. Plus, it's projected that there will be 30,000 jobs at full build-out. So here's the next obvious question: Will people ever be able to actually live there? ""Eventually,"" according to Alan Greenberger, deputy mayor for planning and development and director of commerce. Greenberger joined Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation's John Grady and Liberty Property Trust's Brian Cohen on a panel discussion of the Navy Yard at UPenn last night. During the talk, Greenberger said while the Navy Yard is currently a work-driven campus, the goal is to create ""a culture of different people in one place that can be enjoyed at different hours of the day."" Grady added that the PIDC has been in talks with the U.S. Navy since 2007 to build housing on the campus and are currently negotiating deed restrictions. The tentative timeline, Grady said, is for the PDIC to begin soliciting residential developers in a year. Initial plans considered the creation of a new neighborhood consisting of about 5,000 residential units. ""But we ultimately decided that building a whole neighborhood here that's not yet connected to the city doesn't make sense. You'd have to consider building schools and more transportation,"" said Grady. What's more likely is the development of a smaller number of multi-family rental units for young professionals. In a Philadelphia Inquirer article last April, Grady said that would include a ""combination of renovation of historic loft-type spaces and new construction.""And that's if employees can be convinced to move to the Navy Yard. Grady added that about 80 percent of requests from current tenants is for more food options and conveniences—i.e. laundry, day care, etc.—to be made available on campus. The last 20 percent is for secondary amenities, such as art galleries. · Living in ships' shadows may be reality [Philly.com]· Drug company to build $25M headquarters at Navy Yard [Curbed Philly]"

Rola shared renderings of the development with Curbed Philly and tells us that the project should be completed in late spring 2016.The property is owned by Bay Lay Song Family Trust, which owns Vietnam Cafe and Fu Wah Market across the street. That's led some to think that the retail space may become a food market. Although an appeal was filed earlier this year on the ground that the developers did not consider the impact of the property in regards to air, light, and use impairment, the decision was held in early September and by the looks of it construction has continued. According to public records, the demo phase was completed in July.

Checking in: Plans for the 19th and Chestnut Tower Next to Boyd Theatre,https://philly.curbed.com/2015/11/19/9898504/checking-in-plans-for-19th-and-chestnut-tower-near-boyd-theatre,article,"The residential tower on 19th and Chestnut is now turned, tighter, and taller, explained architect Cecil Baker to the Center City Residents Association meeting last night. Baker and developer Pearl Properties were required by law to present their changes to the neighborhood association before the Civic Design Review meeting on November 24. After months of collaboration with concerned community stakeholders, the redesign contains several tweaks to the 250-unit high-rise.  







1. The tower is now oriented north-south instead of east-west. This orientation will diminish the disruption of views from adjacent buildings, which include Kate's Place on 20th and Sansom Sts., and 1920 Chestnut St. 2. The tower also also been pulled away from these two buildings. As a result, the building has shrunk somewhat, but increased in height from 27 stories to 32.  







3. Truck loading will be off 20th Street, eliminating potential for traffic congestion along Sansom Street, which will be reserved for 16,000-square-foot retail space. The loading area is designed to allow 32-foot trucks to be able to turn around inside the dock so to allow for a ""no-beeping"" zone—i.e. trucks won't have to back into or out of the street. Trash pick-up will also be shared between the tower, Kate's Place, and 1920 Chestnut. 4. Underground parking has doubled from 60 to 117 parking spaces. Despite questions raised by community members, any talk of the Boyd Theatre was shut down at the meeting. A Pearl Properties representative only reaffirmed that the marquee will be preserved and that the ""anticipation is that the lobby will be utilized as a restaurant.""

Update: Camden's Ruby Match Factory Renovation Will Start Next Year,https://philly.curbed.com/2015/11/18/9898978/update-camden-ruby-match-factory-renovation-will-start-next-year,article,"Whenever Jacqueline Buhn talks to a company about moving to Camden, their typical response is this: ""Camden?! No way."" Then, she mentions the New Jersey state tax credits that essentially award companies with free rent for 10 years for moving to the city. ""Then they say, 'Wait—how much money?"" says Buhn, the principal and CEO of Athenian Razak, a Philadelphia-based real estate company that's behind the renovation of Camden's historic Ruby Match Factory at 300 North Delaware Ave.  







That state tax credit is what has lured companies like Subaru, Cooper Health System, and the 76ers to relocate to Camden in recent years. In 2014, for example, the 76ers received $82 million in tax credits to build a practice facility on the Camden waterfront, a project that Athenian Razak is also undertaking. To receive the incentives, a company must create or move 250 employees to Camden and remain in the city for at least 10 years.Buhn says they're still in the process of finding tenants to lease the factory-turned-office space, which was originally constructed between 1891 and 1903. By 1906 it was turned into a Campbell's Soup warehouse. Although renovations were expected to start by the end of this year, Buhn says that's been pushed back to next year. ""Timing is really dependent on what tenants want to do and want to commit to,"" she says, adding that the construction phase may take about 10 months. ""Once we secure final interest from tenants, that's when the renovation will start to fly."" 







 







So what's in the works for the reno? A lot. The roof and windows will be replaced, and two new floor levels will be added to create a 71,520-square-foot office space. ""That will increase floorspace. It will be this magnificent open plan office space where you can see from level to level,"" says Buhn. ""It's really attractive for collaborative use.""  







An ""arts cafe"" is planned for the northeast side of the building, which will serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner and potentially include an outdoor eating space in the back of the building. Buhn says while they won't make any official commitments until office tenants are in place, a number of Philly-based eateries have expressed interest in opening locations there. Buhn would not disclose the projected cost of the project, but as of July 2015 the estimated cost was $20 million.·Camden warehouse could become offices and shops [Philly.com]·Cooper, Subaru get tax deals for moving to Camden [Philly.com]"

The researchers defined neighborhoods as ""gentrifiable"" if they had a median household income below the citywide median at the start of the study period, which was from 2000 to 2013.The study found that the rate of gentrification is most intense around Center City and the neighborhoods surrounding University of Pennsylvania and Temple University, City Lab reports. The homes in these areas are valued at $238,049; in weakly gentrifying areas the median home value is $70,316. But is gentrification hurting or helping Philadelphians? Er, both. The report found that in general, residents who stay in gentrifying neighborhoods actually add about 11 points to their credit score and tend to stay put. But about 20 percent of those who can't afford to pay their neighborhood's growing prices tend to move to areas of lower median income. The researchers write, ""Low-score movers (below 580 or having no scores) who generally have shorter credit histories or who were hit harder during the Great Recession, are more likely to move to neighborhoods with lower incomes, higher crime rates, schools with poorer performance, and/or higher unemployment rates.""· The Closest Look Yet at Gentrification and Displacement [City Lab]· Gentrification and Residential Mobility in Philadelphia [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]"

According to PlanPhilly, opposers of the project argued that the development was too tall and wouldn't ""respect the character of the neighborhood."" Currently, the developer's plans are to raze the Society Hill Playhouse and a two-story garage across the street for a development that will be a maximum of 51 feet tall with 17 units and 18 parking spaces. Previously, the plans were for a building with a maximum height of 60 feet with 24 units and 16 parking spaces. These condos are expected to cost between $500,000 and $1 million. These scaled down plans aren't enough of an improvement for those in the community, though, as they continue to argue that because the zoning for the site is RM-1, a low-density multifamily classification with a 38-foot height limit, the condo project just won't fit in with the neighborhood. PlanPhilly further reported that the developer discovered petroleum contamination underneath the garage property on the west side of 8th Street, which the developer will have to remediate before construction.

KYW Newsradio took to the streets and talked to a few neighbors who are downright giddy about the prospect of the burned-out, vacant building being transformed into ""at least 40 high-end apartments."" Judith Applebaum of the Washington Square West Civic Association went as far as to say she's ""just absolutely thrilled that it is actually happening."" Currently, the sidewalk is blocked off during the construction efforts but Applebaum also noted that ""we are just thrilled that somebody is in there and will actually make the building safe, because right now it's a disaster."" She also noted that she expects that the construction ""could take some time."" Fire tore through the building back in 2006 and the former hotel has sat vacant ever since. It's also been tangled in an odd legal battle that has held up the sale and development efforts. David Perlman eventually bought the building for $2.22M in September of 2013. ""Finally, something good is happening here,"" Chris Ehrmann told KYW Newsradio. According to Hidden City, plans were in place to retain architect Cecil Baker's plans from 2011 that would see 44 apartment units of various sizes, including studio, one- and two-bedroom units.

Eric Blumenfeld Dishes on New Details for The Divine Lorraine,https://philly.curbed.com/2014/7/14/10074598/blumenfeld-dishes-on-new-details-for-the-divine-lorraine,article,"Developer Eric Blumenfeld recently took Hadas Kuznits of KYW Newsradio on a tour through the Divine Lorraine. While they are currently looking at plans to convert it into a grand hotel, he also dished on some new details for the former hotel in an 11-part video interview, mainly that they will look to incorporate two restaurants and a large reception/lobby area on the ground floor that could also contain some sort of salon. Along the way, Blumenfeld notes that each floor plate is just under 12,000 square feet of space. Throughout the video tours, it's evident that the behemoth on Broad Street was gutted by its former owners, with each floor now containing expansive, open floor plans. The bones, however, are still beautiful and it's easy to see how this property could very well become the centerpiece of a newly revitalized North Broad Street. Blumenfeld and Kuznitz even go all UrbEx on you in Video 10 as they explore the roof and its iconic sign. Sadly, Blumenfeld notes that there will be no roof access once renovations are complete. Blumenfeld was particularly moved by the alabaster staircases, at one time noting how they feel like that should be in a museum. However, one of the most interesting pieces pertained to  two large skylights — one on the roof and another on the roof of lobby — which can be seen from the interior shaft courtyard. Blumenfeld mentioned they are currently just covered and that they will look to restore them to their former glory. The one in the courtyard is of particular note as you will be able to look down into from interior balconies and up through the building from the grand lobby area. Apparently, the hotel housed a speakeasy at one point. It was located in the basement of the property and will eventually connect to one of the restaurant spaces. Video 4 is also fun as it give you a look into Mother Divine's apartment. It hangs over the interior courtyard and connects the 10th floor to make a complete circuit. It can been seen from Broad Street and a better view is available in Video 8.

Though the bank opened up in a bland office building (and not a cutesy storefront), it seems that chains are beginning to develop more of a presence in Old City.Last week, news that the iconic Shirt Corner storefront would become a CVS was mostly greeted with praise: after all, the new CVS will be accompanied by a historic reconstruction and a glass display case of artwork.  The new storefront will, however, certainly be a less visually interesting than what stands now.  A 7-11 is also in the works at 2nd and Market.  Old City has, up until now, managed to preserve a varied streetscape dominated by independent shops and restaurants.  Though three new corporate stores won't change the entire character of the neighborhood, it does seem that the trend in Old City is toward new chains rather than new boutiques. Even seemingly successful independent retailers like Three Sirens Boutique are closing.  Is it possible that last year's dissolution of the Old City Civic Association's development committee is to blame for this trend?  Though it's impossible to say what the neighborhood looks like in the alternate universe where the OCCA is still fighting character changing developments tooth and nail, it is worth noting the connection between new chains and the dissolution of the OCCA's development committee. · Development And Redevelopment Projects Underway In Historic Old City [CBS Philly]· Under (Legal) Pressure: OCCA Silenced by SLAPPs [Curbed Philly]"

The project, which will occupy the site where Philadelphia International Records' home  will be ""the tallest residentially focused building"" in Pennsylvania.  The hotel will be called the ""SLS International"": it'll be run by SLS hotels, and the name will recall the site's former use as the home of Philadelphia International Records, the birthplace of the Philadelphia Sound. 







[Rendering via The Inquirer]Dranoff noted that the success of the project will depend upon City Council's changing the zoning code: by extending a zoning designation which currently ends at Spruce Street south to Pine,the building will be able to have a larger square footage (relative to how big the lot is).The building itself will be a mixed-use luxury boutique hotel with 149 guest rooms, six suites, and 125 condos (the condos and hotel will have separate entrances.)   Parking, the main concern of all the city's neighbors, is also covered: 220 spaces will be provided for hotel guests and condo residents.  SLS International will also house a ""double height"" glass ballroom, and street level retail, to include a bar/restaurant, and shops. Dranoff said, ""Great cities build great buildings"", perhaps feeding hopes that it'll be a little different from Dranoff's other project South Broad Tower, Symphony House, (which archicritic Inga Saffron has referred to as ""a Frankenstein mix of historical elements"", ""a clumsy, contemporary fake"", ""decorated with the padded-shoulder pomposity of the Reagan era"", and ""like a sequined and over-rouged strumpet""). The architect, A. Eugene Kohn, is a Philly local who attended Central High School and UPenn.  The hotel brand, SLS, is known for super trendy designs, and their website states that they like to foster ""elements of creativity and community"".  The man behind SLS Hotels, Sam Nazarian, emphasized that the new hotel on Broad Street would ""elevate"" the ""creativity"" that ""Philadelphia is already committed to...through the Avenue of the Arts"".  Perhaps it's ironic that a hotel developer planning to put in a luxury hotel and condo skyscraper where Philadelphia International Records created the Philadelphia Sound, but it seems unlikely that Dranoff would have announced the project without knowing that it would get approved.

""We have over 50 plots, with two common herb plots, lots of flowers and a couple fruit trees,"" said Trevor McElroy, one of the 50-odd people who gardens on South St. Bernard.Now McElroy and his fellow gardeners are working with Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell to try to get the city to buy the land at auction so the gardeners can stay. But if the city is outbid by developers, all those lettuces and tomatoes will be homeless. The land is more valuable now than it was when the garden started in the late 1990s. City records show that the house across the street from the garden sold for $300,000 in 2010. Even the odd triangular plots the garden sits on will be a temptation for many developers, though we're guessing West Philly's gardeners have serious grassroots fundraising chops.The group has a website where people can donate to the cause.

Idaszak says Philadelphia's prices for warehouse space are not what he would call hot, but they're ""among the warmer"" compared with other metro areas. Philadelphia is faring better than many cities because it's well situated near a number of coastal ports.  A recent survey of investors, said Idaszak, showed that about 25 percent think it's a good time to buy industrial and warehouse property in Philadelphia while another quarter think it's a good time to sell. The remaining 50 percent suggest doing neither—just hold onto a warehouse if you've already got one.· Vacant Warehouse Lights the Spark of DIY Imagination [CPHI]· Cedar Park Warehouse Is in the Process of Becoming [CPHI]· Rather Pretty Warehouse Loft for Rent in Olde Kensington/NoLibs [CPHI]"

There'll be updates and tenant applications when it's closer to being done.

If you're having trouble remembering what used to be in that spot, it was the modernist Sidney Hillman Medical Center designed by Louis Magaziner. Dilapidated though it was, it held a special place in many Philadelphians' hearts—and not just people who understood why the preservation of modernist buildings is important. There were plenty of other people who just considered it a stalwart, if only due to years of walking by and thinking, ""That place is weird and kind of dirty.""Because it was a modernist structure, the developers of 2116 had to make a case for its demolition before the the Philadelphia Historical Commission. PlanPhilly had this to say about it in 2009:Folks at First Unitarian Church were also concerned about the implications:It's interesting to remember all the objections to the building on a day that really proves it's here. Eventually, all the opposition gets forgotten, and things like dirty modernist buildings and stained glass reflections vanish. How many such ghosts do we walk by every day?"

New developers have clashed with longtime residents; the city's plan for the area has become the target of grassroots opposition; and a fracas known as Lotgate made headlines internationally. The latest wrinkle brings some lightness of being to the proceedings. A reader wrote to say he heard that the Electrical Workers' Local 98 had a protest at the Lotgate garden—which doesn't have any electricity. ""Supposedly [the union] shut down 20th Street and tried (unsuccessfully) to drive a cherry picker into the garden,"" the reader wrote. ""When that didn't work, they supposedly measured the garden to play horseshoes. Then they played horseshoes.""Later that day, the tipster snapped a photo of two police cruisers across from the lot/garden, which he believes were there to monitor the potentially explosive horseshoes situation—though are there even cops in those cars? It's hard to tell, but the way they're parked, it doesn't exactly seem like a crack surveillance team.

Developers who are new to a neighborhood should approach longtime residents with respect, understand what their concerns are, and be explicit about future plans. Longtime residents don't want to live in poor conditions, Johnson said—""who wants a lot where people are doing drugs?""—but they're afraid.

Though the Pestronks were willing to use union labor, they also wanted the option of using non-union workers, which wasn't to the union's liking. So the Pestronks did something virtually unheard of in Philadelphia: They went ahead without the unions. This caused enormous upset and embarrassing, thuggish behavior by union protesters. The site has come to represent the essential tensions between building trade unions and developers in Philadelphia, begging some fairly important questions that city politicians, for one, are afraid to ask lest they lose the support of organized labor. Now Ryan Briggs reports that the Goldtex battle may be over, though no agreement has been signed:From the Pestronks' point of view, nothing has changed: They've long advocated a mixed workplace (union and non-union labor) and they still do; the only difference is that the union is finally willing to work in such an environment if they get paid a higher rate.

What the New Divine Lorraine Apts. Might Look Like,https://philly.curbed.com/2012/8/15/10339720/what-the-new-divine-lorraine-might-look-like,article," It seems that developer Eric Blumenfeld will be the eventual buyer of the Divine Lorraine. From the Inquirer:Blumenfeld's plans for the Broad Street behemoth would be a mix of residential and commercial—the kind of redevelopment he's handled in that neighborhood before. The above video shows one of his North Broad conversions, Lofts 640, a building that also houses Marc Vetri's restaurant Osteria. Blumenfeld's other area project may be more responsible than any other for the idea that North Broad is a viable corridor for development. He transformed a section of what was once known as Automobile Row into a culinary destination that includes Vie, Stephen Starr's Route 6 and Marc Vetri's Alla Spina.

Young Developer Proposes East Passyunk Rental Units for King of Jeans Spot,https://philly.curbed.com/2012/7/19/10350058/developer-proposes-east-passyunk-rental-units-for-young-single,article,"By Peter CrimminsRumors of its death may have been exaggerated, but they are not entirely inaccurate. The King of Jeans, and its iconic Patrick Nagel-esque sign at 13th and Passyunk Avenue, have been edging toward kaput for a few years. Now there are ""going out of business"" signs in the windows, and a new kid on the block might deal the killing blow. Max Glass (son of TV personality Nancy Glass) came before the planning committee of the East Passyunk Crossing Civic Association last night to reveal his plans to renovate 1843 E. Passyunk, which is actually four buildings awkwardly cobbled together. He wants develop the second, third and fourth stories into a dozen one-bedroom apartments, keeping retail on the street floor. The buildings allow for six units by right; he needs a zoning variance to build 12.The meeting took place in a small chapel on the 11th Street campus of the Saints John Neumann and Maria Goretti High School. It was drowning in the hum of an ancient window air unit doing its best on the hottest day the year, until somebody turned it down. ""If you don't have a South Philly voice that can be heard, get one!"" yelled Joe Marino, co-chair of the civic association, turning the AC unit back up. The room of about 16 long-time residents strained to hear Max Glass, 25, pitch his project. If Glass' vision becomes reality, it will be another step in the unstoppable Brooklyn-ization of the neighborhood: twelve one-bedroom units of 650 to 850 square feet, with 8-foot ceilings, renting for about $1,000 to young professionals 25 to 35 years old. ""People like me,"" said Glass. The room nodded in approval at the prospect of an influx of the young, single people, but chafed at the parking issues. Glass insisted the tenants will be encouraged to not own cars, instead use public transportation, bicycles and Zipcar. Glass' first and only development, still being completed, is a mixed-use building at 22nd and Catharine, which will bring a new Ultimo coffeeshop into Graduate Hostpital next month. He does not yet have a committment for a business to take over the throne from the King of Jeans. And the sign. What to do with the sign? Glass acknowledged a public love/hate relationship with the sign. It can't stay, as it will likely compete with whatever business takes over the space, and will get in the way of future apartment windows. A committee person gamely suggested it could be donated to the Philadelphia History Museum at Atwater Kent. But the prospect of preserving the 40-year-old sign, whose aesthetic relevance ended with Duran Duran, caused one longtime resident to yelp, ""What?!"" The meeting was an informational session. Final approval of the plan by East Passyunk Crossing, and then by the city's Zoning Board, is several months off."

The Community Design Collaborative created a blueprint for the CDC to encourage this kind of growth, but so far the CDC has only been able to implement a couple of the suggestions. Planters are all well and good, but it'll take funding to truly get those tentacles out there.

Philly Housing Authority Pops Its Sustainable Cherry,https://philly.curbed.com/2012/5/11/10372012/philly-housing-authority-pops-its-green-development-cherry,article,"The Norris Apartments near Temple—the Philadelphia Housing Authority's first LEED-certified green development—opened yesterday in a ceremony in front of the building. The units are equipped with all that environmentally happy stuff that's required to get certification—solar panels, toilets that flush lazily, et cetera. And also CFL light fixtures, which are really the only major drawback to being a good citizen of the earth. (One of the questions on the CFLFacts.com FAQ is, ""Why does my CFL make me look like a cadaver?"") In February, Naked Philly heaped praise on the project, saying, ""These homes are, from both an architectural and an environmental standpoint, a dramatic improvement over pretty much anything we’ve seen from PHA to this point. Hopefully, this project will become the gold standard for new construction from the Housing Authority.""There has been criticism of the Norris Apartments project, notably from Stephen Smith of Forbes.com (whose mother was fired by PHA, just FYI) and Stephen Stofka of Hidden City. Smith objects to the development's allotted space for parking and a grassy courtyard, which he says is a waste considering the proximity to SEPTA. Stofka adds that the rear of the units have vinyl and aluminum. ""How, exactly, is that green? The solar panels are a nice touch but the flat roofs will eventually leak. A gabled roof would have added precious space (an attic) while better directing rainwater flow.""Along those lines, the Norris Apartments development is a pilot program between PHA and the Philadelphia Water Department to address stormwater runoff.

"Hey, Bart, What About the Viaduct?",https://philly.curbed.com/2012/4/17/10379122/reading-viaduct-folks-to-meet-with-bart-blatstein,article,"First, a bit of a primer since we often mention the Reading Viaduct without explanation. The Viaduct is the name for a stretch of elevated train tracks that's no longer used. It's overgrown and off-limits (though not every urban explorer believes that) and currently serves no purpose. There's an ongoing movement in Philly to reinvent the Viaduct as green space, as other cities have done. It's a good time for it: There are efforts in both D.C. and New York to reclaim abandoned rail stations and underground terminals that show real promise. And the Rail to Trail Conservancy, whose mission is to transform former rail lines into green space, has long championed successful efforts. In March, Brian Flanagan, the city's Chief of Staff to the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, spoke at a panel on the future of North Broad. Flanagan has been working with the Planning Commission and the Department of Commerce to find intersections between the development of North Broad and that of the Reading Viaduct. Not long after that panel, we featured some before-and-after renderings commissioned by the Center City District to demonstrate what an elevated park on the City Branch of the Viaduct might look like. Much of the credit for awareness of the Reading Viaduct's potential goes to the organization VIADUCTgreene, whose Leah Murphy—Senior Associate Urban Designer and Planner at Interface Studio—keeps us up to date on all things Viaduct. When Bart Blatstein announced his grand plans for a casino in the former Inquirer/Daily News building on North Broad, Viaduct dreamers couldn't help but consider how his plans would impact the viability of their project. ""His decisions,"" says Murphy, ""could make or break the continuity of a linear park along the City Branch west of Broad—connecting the SEPTA-owned stretch to the first phase of the 9th Street branch on the SEPTA spur east of Broad."" And while Blatstein's casino plans are likely to take a long time to resolve (see: Foxwoods), Murphy notes that time is of the essence. ""Timely consideration of the intersection of Broad with the City Branch is needed because PennDOT is currently evaluating alternatives for replacing the Broad Street bridge over the City Branch,"" she says. ""Their low-cost scenario is actually to fill in the void under the bridge—essentially making it a road—which would, of course, remove any possibility of a gardenpark connection under Broad.""The organization is in communication with PennDOT’s engineering consultants, and they’re meeting with Blatstein tomorrow, which is crucial considering that he's acquired ""such a large and critical chunk of the City Branch,"" as Murphy puts it. Let's hope her team can explain to Blatstein the need for public space.· Subterranean Dreams: Exploring a New Frontier in Rail-Trails  [Rails to Trails Conservancy]"
Nerd-Event Scalper Now an Official Job Title in Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2012/2/29/10392394/nerdevent-scalper-now-an-official-job-title-in-philly,article,"Look, it's a tough economy, we all have to make do. Perhaps when you were young, you made tie-dye T-shirts in the basement of your friend's house and took them to Phish shows and sold them outside the stadium without a permit.

The point is: Why not nerd events? (And when we say, ""nerd,"" we say it with love.

Doley is encouraged by what she's seen: a steady rise in community organizing, citizen planning and participation in development issues. ""It's development of the neighborhood's business corridors and blighted and vacant land that will play a major role in shaping Germantown's future,"" she says, ""which is why Germantown United CDC's focus begins with sustainable commercial corridor development.

So What Happened at the Meeting About the Apple Lofts?,https://philly.curbed.com/2012/2/16/10395556/so-what-happened-at-the-meeting-about-the-apple-lofts-project,article,"Note: Curbed Philly's policy on community development debates is very Switzerland. We prefer to let the people who live in the neighborhoods take sides. If you attend a community meeting and would like to give us your take, ping our tipline: philly@curbed.com. 







The below summary of last night's community meeting to debate the Apple Lofts project comes from Amara Rockar, who lives in West Philadelphia and supports the project. For the perspective of someone who opposes the project, head over the UC Review website and listen to a radio interview with Shawn Kelly of the West Philly Community Achievement Association.  Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell got up and reiterated that taxes are determined by comparison to similar properties and Apple Storage has no similar properties in the immediate area. She also said some vague noncommittal things like when well-intentioned people get together, a solution can be found, and she respects the will of the majority.And then the shouting commenced:· The development is going increase property taxes on single family homes in the area and the homeowners on 52nd Street aren't going to be able to afford their houses anymore and a) new people will buy them and it won't be the same neighborhood anymore, and b) the houses will become vacant and blight the community, and c) the developer is going to acquire them or d) some combination of the above.· The six to seven expected jobs created by this development aren't enough—the warehouse should be used industrially so there are more jobs. The developer said he is in the business of developing residences, not industry and no one has approached him about that kind of use in the five years he's owned the building. The developer also reiterated that he was open to hiring from the community, including for the renovation work.· The warehouse should go back to storage space use because it employed people, even alcoholics. The developer said he does not run a storage space business.· The warehouse should be a senior center. The developer was open to some kind of center coming in to the first-floor commercial if a tenant is interested. He told everyone that he does not run senior centers.· A lot of people made demands on the developer to show his ""support for the community"" and listed services city government is technically responsible for providing.One woman, who owns on 52nd Street and was opposed because of the taxes, requested that the developer have his construction workers go down 52nd Street and fix up residents' homes. Such improvements would increase her home value and her assessment and therefore her taxes more certainly and immediately than the development.· Monica Allison of Cedar Park Neighbors pointed out that the average prices for apartments in 19143 are $675 to $1,400 and so the developer's range of $800 for a studio to $1,300 for a two-bedroom, especially newly renovated, isn't exactly out of line. Many people discounted this. The developer said that a few longtime residents have come up to him after meetings (never during) to look at the layouts and pick out the apartment they plan to rent when the development opens. · One person opposed the project because the rents would attract wealthier people who would bring more crime to the neighborhood because then people would want to rob them on their way into the building.· A resident on 52nd Street was upset that there would be 112 apartments but only 92 parking spaces so where is she going to park?· There was anger about not being notified but west of 52nd Street there's no neighborhood association for developers to contact. The Zoning Board of Adjustments (ZBA) specifically says developers have to meet with Registered Community Organizations, which have to have boards, bylaws, regular meetings, etc. Again not nice things about Cedar Park Neighbors were said and the fact that 52nd Street is its western boundary.· There were longtime residents, usually much quieter, who were excited about the project and that a developer was interested in coming to the area. One stood up and said he understood the concern about taxes but that people were saying they'd oppose the project if the developer didn't show support for the community but if he doesn't and people successfully oppose it, how does keeping a warehouse vacant support the community?Shawn Kelly ended the meeting kind of abruptly. I don't know if the church needed everyone to get out or what. Shawn indicated that not much had be resolved and there was a need for the discussion to continue. We got to vote whether we supported the project on paper ballots, but Shawn kept saying they were ""sample ballots"" and never explained what, if anything, the vote would determine."

The piece compares the Yard to other waterfront development projects (Baltimore, New York) and discusses the challenges to this one—pedestrian access chief among them. The piece, by Philadelphia-based Luke Barley, is accompanied by some of that ruin porn we love so much.

Community Dissent Over Proposed Apple Lofts on 52nd St.,https://philly.curbed.com/2012/2/9/10397586/community-dissent-over-the-transformation-of-52nd-st,article,"Here are the basics: Iron Stone Management wants to take the vacant Apple Storage facility at 708 S. 52nd St. and convert it from an industrial space into a residential one, with plans to build 100-plus apartments and a retail center in the bottom of the building. As with all such neighborhood plans, there are factions who are for it and factions against, and the locus of the tensions lies in the groups that claim neighborhood ownership, of a kind, via community groups.The groups in this neighborhood battle are the Cedar Park Neighbors (CPN), the Baltimore Avenue Business Association (BABA) and the Community Achievement Association (CAA). As it stands now, CPN and BABA (volunteer organizations) are in favor of the project; CAA (which is paid by the city) is not. The University City Review has covered the arguments in a series of two articles, the second of which came out this week. As of last description, the property would include 112 ""loft-style"" apartments with prices ranging from $700 to $1,400, no subsidized housing included. The plan calls for hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and exposed brick walls. An initial objection by the Zoning Board was the lack of sufficient parking, but Ironstone returned to the table with additional parking spaces (as well as bike storage). Meanwhile, one of the concerns from CAA has been the issue of the 10-year tax abatement that would be attached to the this project. A local West Philadelphia real estate broker has offered an explanation of tax abatement on a neighborhood listserve today, hoping the information could be passed along to CAA. Here's that broker's explanation:2.  Properties with tax abatements do not pay zero taxes. They continue to pay the same taxes they were already paying. The abatement is only on tax INCREASES on the property during the period for which taxes are abated. In other words, if a property owner fixes up a run-down place and applies for the tax abatement, the city won't ""penalize"" him/her for their project by immediately charging them higher taxes. It doesn't mean that the city won't charge ANY taxes. The city will still charge the CURRENT taxes. The next community meeting to discuss the project is on Feb. 15. If you have any stake in this community, you might want to attend. Here's the info:When: Wed., Feb. 15, 7pmWhere: A.M.E. Church, 815 S. 53rd St.  "

Spring Garden School, built between 1927-1928 at 845 N. 12th Street, celebrated its grand opening on Veterans Day with a new name and new lease on life: The Lural Lee Blevins Veterans Center and HELP Philadelphia V, a home for 37 veterans and individuals aged 55 and older. “This is the final piece of the puzzle for this community,” said City Council President Darrell Clarke, who represents the 5th Council District, at Friday’s grand opening.Twelve of the affordable housing units are for veterans, and the other units are for individuals earning 60 percent below the area’s median income. There’s also a rooftop garden and playground and on-site services by HELP USA, like healthcare, counseling, and employment opportunities. The $13.7 million undertaking is a venture between the Philadelphia Housing Authority and HELP USA. Work officially began more than a year ago in September 2016. The building is named after the late Specialist 4 Lural Lee Blevins III, a resident of North Philly who died in the Vietnam War.The grand reopening comes decades after the Spring Garden School closed its doors in the 1970s. Over the years, it has sat vacant as the surrounding area, especially along North Broad, has seen some revitalization efforts. The school stands tall among the Richard Allen townhouse community, and was the last-remaining structure to be redeveloped. But the work isn’t over now that the adaptive reuse project is complete. HELP USA also announced at the opening that it plans to level the small grassy hill next to the school and turn it into a soccer field for the neighborhood. "
Sneak Peek: Inside and above the 34-story Alexander tower,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/6/16598886/alexander-apartments-philadelphia-photos,article,"For the past two years, the 34-story Alexander tower, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects (RAMSA) and BLT Architects, has been on the rise at 1601 Vine Street. When it finally opens in late January 2018, it will be the tallest residential building in Logan Square, packed with apartments, amenities, and a 12,000-square-foot daycare on the ground floor.But the panoramic views are what really make the tower stand out—and there is no shortage of terraces to take advantage of them. The Alexander, named after the famed local sculptor Alexander Calder who created the William Penn statue atop City Hill, broke ground in 2015 and has been on the rise ever since, through the completion of the Mormon Temple across the street. Property Reserve, Inc. (PRI), a subsidiary of the Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints, is the owner of the Alexander. To be clear, the 483,000-square-foot tower is still very much a construction zone. But on a recent tour of the property, work was moving along at a fast clip in preparation of the January 22 deadline. Unlike other developments, where residents often tend to move in amid construction, all 277 units at the Alexander will be finished and ready for occupancy by January. The nearly 300 units are a mix of apartments and townhouses—both rentals. There are studios, one-bedroom, two-bedroom apartments ranging from $1,675 to $5,920 a month. Meanwhile, the 13 townhomes range from $3,620 for a three-bedroom to $5,900 for a four-bedroom. Each have private entries, one off Vine Street and another from the three-story underground parking garage.  “Variety is all over this place,” says construction project manager Craig Homer, who has overseen the buildout of the Alexander’s 51 different floor plans. Leasing only just started, and five apartments had been rented at the time of publication. The townhouses in particular seem to have attracted empty nesters and families, says community manager Tracy Keyser.“We’re getting a little bit of everybody. But with these townhomes, it’s really been empty nesters who are selling their big homes in the suburbs and moving into the city,” says Keyser. “They come in and they say, ‘We just want to live care-free in retirement.’” That shouldn’t be a problem. Like most new developments going up throughout Philly, the Alexander comes with a long list of amenities. There’s the amenity level on the second floor with an outdoor terrace with built-in grills and an indoor lap pool. The gym is on this level, too, with 20-plus-foot-tall ceilings. There are 300 parking spaces in the three-story parking garage—more than enough for each unit—and bike storage spaces on every level, too. And, because no apartment tower is complete these days without pet amenities, says Keyser, there will be dog wash on site, too. Perhaps what sets the Alexander apart from other high-rises, though, is its plethora of private outdoor space. Nearly all of the townhouses and more than half of the apartments in the tower have either back patios, balconies, or wrap-around terraces. The crème de la crème of all of the apartments can be found on the 32nd floor, where there are four penthouse units, each with a private terrace. A corner unit on this floor features large windows—even the soaking tub in the master bathrooms has views of Logan Square far down below. That unit comes with a hefty rental price tag: $5,185 a month. Still, the views aren’t only reserved for future penthouse dwellers. On the very top of the building on the 34th floor, there will be an observation deck available to all residents. “We’re isolated from downtown, not trapped in our views,” says Homer. The Alexander is leasing now and scheduled to open in late January. "
"Guest-Rm, a home-sharing service for friends, launches in Philly",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/3/16586774/guest-rm-extended-stay-rental-hotel,article,"A new startup based here in Philly is on a mission to take the awkwardness out of asking friends to let their mom and pops crash at their place for a night. It’s called Guest-Rm (pronounced “Guest Room”), and it’s the brainchild of Josh Angotti, who came up with the idea after realizing that his and his wife’s 450-square-foot studio would in no way be able to accommodate his cousins for their annual reunion. “I just don’t have the space for it. And if I wanted to get hotel rooms, it’d be cost prohibitive,” recalls Angotti. That’s when Angotti turned to his friends for help. “I thought that nobody’s in Philadelphia over Memorial Day or Labor Day weekend. Most of my friends would be more than willing to have my cousins stay in their place, but there’s no real precedent for making a request like that in our culture.”Guest-Rm was born out of Josh’s willingness to break what could be an awkward conversation. He, his wife, and partner Laura Barron have spent the past few months working out all of the ins and outs of the startup (in Angotti’s case, obsessively checking to make sure that a service of this kind doesn’t already exist. It doesn’t.). Here’s how it works, in Angotti’s words: “It’s a home-sharing network for friends and friends and friends—with no nightly fees.”Users can sign up to Guest-Rm via their Facebook account and see which of their friends or friends of friends have their homes available. After that, it’s just a flat $20 reservation fee, no matter how many nights you’re staying in the home. Guest-Rm also recommends that guests purchase a thank you gift in the in the form of a $25 gift card for the host.The low-cost model of the service is what separates it from other similar services out there like AirBnB or VRBO. “There’s a different value proposition from a supply side,” Angotti says. “I don’t see it as a replacement—it’s not going to offer a revenue stream. Sure, it’s nice to get a gift card, but it’s not going to pay your bills.”Angotti says while some folks may always prefer staying in a hotel or a rental, he suspects that Guest-Rm will attract people who may feel uncomfortable staying in a stranger’s home, but may be priced out of hotel options. “It makes it less of a stretch to ask to use somebody’s home or apartment while they’re gone—especially when they’ve already volunteered it.”The Guest-Rm online service launched today in a beta version. Angotti says that the plan is to stick around Philly for awhile; if it catches on, they’ll consider expanding the service to more cities and places around the country. "
Upscale apartment service Stayawhile launches in Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/11/2/16589970/hotel-apartment-bnb-stayawhile-philadelphia,article,"A new kind of extended-stay apartment service has come to Philly, this time catering to the middle tier of so-called digital nomads. Stayawhile, a global network of furnished and high-end apartments designed for medium-length stays, has launched in the heart of Philly’s Old City neighborhood in a new building at 300 Market Street.The service has described itself to Curbed as such: “It’s as if Airbnb and Soho House had a baby.” Essentially, it touts itself for offering a more flexible model of housing, so that anyone—whether you’re in between homes, renovating, or constantly traveling for work—can rent them out. Here’s how it works: Users apply for membership and must pass credit checks. Once approved, members have access to all Stayawhile locations worldwide. Since different cities have different housing laws, the minimum length of stay varies, but 30 days is required at the Philly location. If you tend to visit a certain city a lot, there’s also the option for a Stayawhile Trunk. This trunk will be inside your apartment when you walk through the door, stacked with whatever you’ve left behind from your last visit. Stayawhile only started in June 2017, and just recently started its services in Philly in October. All of the units are studios that are furnished and fully equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, and laundry.  There’s a focus on high-end design, too, making them more appealing than your standard corporate housing setup. Each studio has furniture by Article, Parachute bedding, and Crate and Barrel products. They also all have voice-activated Amazon television and Echo Dots. At the building at 3rd and Market, there are three apartments available. The rates are $78 per day and about $2,340 per month. "
"Baby boomers are the Philly regions next wave of renters, report says",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/31/16569776/philadelphia-renter-demographics-baby-boomers,article,"In Philly, there’s a lot of talk about millennials. According to reports, these young adults are moving to the region in droves, which is one of the main reasons why apartment construction has boomed here over the past couple of years. And yet, new research shows that it’s not just millennials that this city should be banking on when it comes to its developing apartment market—baby boomers are on track to be the next big wave of renters in Philly and across the country. Real estate website Rent Cafe reports that across the U.S., there has been a dramatic changes in terms of demographics among renters: Between 2009 and 2015, the number of renters aged 55 and older increased by 28 percent, according to U.S. Census data. That number dropped to 3 percent among renters 34 and younger.The same trend was discovered in the Philadelphia region. This area has seen just 8 percent of millennials joining the rental market, but an impressive 22 percent increase in the number of renters aged 55 and older.  There are a few reasons for this boom in senior renters, perhaps most notably that many of them are recent empty nesters who want to downsize from their big suburban homes, all while staying close to their kids. Furthermore, the study also found that among these senior renters, both families with children and families without children prefer to stay in the suburbs.Specifically, families with no children saw a 22 percent increase and families with children jumped by 16 percent in suburban areas. Meanwhile, Philly proper saw a 13 percent increase in families without kids and a 4 percent uptick in the number of families with children.This trend isn’t news to developer Bozzuto, who had been closely monitoring this growing population of new renters for the past five years. “We identified this as a spot where we thought there was a significant need, but not a lot of great product out there for this demographic,” says Pete Sikora, Bozzuto development manager. After spending years figuring out what this demographic of potential renters wanted in terms of amenities, Bozzuto came up with Canvas Valley Forge, an amenity-driven  mixed-use development right next to the King of Prussia Town Center. When it opens in late November, it will be the first apartment community of its kind for renters ages 55 and up. Like most new apartment buildings in Philly and the surrounding region, Canvas comes with a long list of amenities, including an inner courtyard with a pool, a grilling station, as well as a gourmet kitchen and a game room. But some other features offered to the senior renters take the development to another level, says Michelle Kearney, Bozzuto’s regional portfolio manager.There’s an on-site activities director, for example, who is responsible for cultivating a social community type of atmosphere designed especially for this demographic, through daily activities or trips. There are also daily continental breakfast, brunches, happy hours, and wine tastings. The apartments are designed to mimic single-family homes, too. Sikora says, “Our units have been designed to integrate single-family home features into them to make the transition a little easier.” There are entrance foyers in each apartment, master suites with dressing rooms, and extra storage. “A lot of folks are going to be downsizing, but still want to keep a lot of the stuff they already have.” New developments in Philly proper, meanwhile, have attracted empty nesters, as well, though less so in the rental market than the high-end condo market. New towers like One Riverside and 500 Walnut, which both fetch top-dollar price tags, have advertised themselves as prime spots for empty nesters also looking to downsize from their Main Line mansions. But while these new condo owners may have the option of designing their own luxurious pads, Sikora says renting is attractive to other senior renters who aren’t quite ready to commit to their next forever home. “It’s not whereas you buy a condo you could get stuck with it—renting an apartment is a one-year or 15-month lease and you can leave after that,” Sikora figures. “So it gives these folks an option to do what they want and not feel they have to fully commit and put a large down payment down.”That’s also why Canvas is experimenting with a commitment-free option for potential renters, explains Sarah McMeekin, property manager at Canvas. “If after 60 days they decide the renting lifestyle isn’t for them, they can end their lease with no penalties.” Rents, meanwhile, are market-rate and start at $2,100.“We think our concept is going to be effective because it provides flexibility,” says Sikora. “As the baby boomers have gotten older and the challenges of up-keeping a house have gotten harder and harder, they’ve started to decide, ‘Hey, I’d rather spend my time doing the things I want to do and not worrying about maintenance and upkeep of my house.”"
Post Brothers finishes $100M renovation at Presidential City,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/20/16507432/presidential-city-post-brothers-renovations-complete,article,"It took three years and $100 million, but renovations at Presidential City on the very edge of Philly and Bala Cynwyd are complete. Developer Post Brothers has announced that it has finished its overhaul of the Adams, the fourth and final apartment tower at Presidential City at 3900 City Avenue. With 1,000 apartments total, it marks the completion of what’s the developer says is the largest redevelopment residential project in the city, which Post Brothers began in 2014. All four of the towers are named after U.S. presidents. The original intention of Presidential City’s developer John McShain in 1950 was to build 48 towers that would be named after all of the presidents. He only managed to build the Washington, Madison, Adams, and Jefferson before selling the rest of the land.Post Brothers bought the property on the edge of Philly near Bala Cynwyd in 2012 for $80 million, and began renovations in 2014. At the time, the rentals had suffered from years of neglect and were pretty dated. Now, the studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments feature finishes like sustainable hardwood floors, soaking tubs, and porcelain tile. The units range from $1,000 to $4,500. The heart of the massive apartment complex is the amenity-laden Sora Pool Club. This has been open for more than a year and features three salt-water pools, bocce courts, a gym, and multiple terraces. Although Presidential City is the Post Brothers’ largest redevelopment project to date, the developer has a number of other projects currently underway throughout the city. The redevelopment of the historic Hamilton and six other residential properties is ongoing in University City, and construction continues at the 21-story Atlantic tower on South Broad Street. "
The Curtis building nabs $173M loan to help finish apartments conversion,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/10/16452280/curtis-building-philadelphia-construction-renovation-apartments,article,"The developers behind the renovation of the historic Curtis building on Washington Square just nabbed a $173.25 million loan that will help bring construction of luxury apartments to the finish line.JLL Capital Markets announced that it secured the multi-million dollar loan for developer and owner Keystone Property Group. Some of the funds will be used to pay off some debt, while $30 million will go toward the completion of the Curtis building’s 63 residential units and future office and retail space. Keystone Property Group purchased the building at 6th and Walnut for $125 million in 2014. Soon after, the developer began renovations on the property, restoring the 12-story atrium and bringing on tenants like the restaurant P.J. Clarke’s.A post shared by Lyndon at The Curtis (@liveatlyndon) on Aug 30, 2017 at 8:15am PDTThe debut of the residential component, dubbed the Lyndon at the Curtis, has been pushed back by months. The 63 high-end luxury units are located on the upper floors of the 12-story building. Though it was expected to start leasing for late spring move-ins, it is now leasing for the fall. Currently, prices range from $2,702 for a 899-square-foot one-bedroom apartment to $6,585 for a 1,681-square-foot three-bedroom unit. Eventually, there will also be apartments up to 2,000 square feet available. In an interview with Curbed Philly earlier this year, Rich Gottlieb of Keystone Property Group said views from the apartments are just one of the perks. Residents will also have access to a long list of amenities like a clubroom, fitness center, private dining room, and a dog spa. Gottlieb said residential component of the Curtis made sense for the neighborhood, where there is still room for rentals in a condo-heavy location. The hope is that the addition of restaurants, retail, office, and residential to Washington Square will help it become a 24/7 destination versus a nine-to-five hub, he said. According to the Lyndon’s website, some of the first apartments will be move-in ready by late October. "
4 lovely A-Frames near Philly you can escape to this fall,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/10/5/16402546/a-frame-cabin-rentals-pennsylvania,article,"In case you missed the news, A-Frames are back. These triangular-shaped homes were a hit when they first started popping up across the country in the 1950s, and now they’re appealing to the masses yet again in the age of Instagram and the minimalist movement. Fortunately, small towns around Philly are home to a few of these A-Frames, and a number of them are available to rent right now. There’s a recently renovated traditional A-Frame in Lancaster’s countryside, or you can escape even farther out from the city and rent a cabin around the Poconos. Either way, your chance to appease your A-Frame longing is within a two hour’s drive of Philly. Here’s a recently renovated A-Frame located in Lancaster’s Amish country. It manages to sleep four: There’s a main bedroom on the first floor and a loft with a sleeper sofa. There’s also a full kitchen sans dishwasher, plus a fire pit near the deck for those cold fall nights. $139 per night. Just south of Lancaster at Historic Sickman’s Hill is this oversized A-Frame overlooking a large creek. It sleeps nine, and there are two decks that face the water. Sickman’s Hill, a 19th-century flour and grist roller mill, is just a short walk away. $150 per night. Located in Bushkill, Pennslyvania within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area is this cabin hidden in the woods. It’s not your typical A-Frame, because it manages to squeeze in three bedrooms. Given its location, there’s plenty to do nearby, whether it’s hiking, checking out Bushkill Falls, or just hanging around the cabin. $150 per night. Less than two hours from Philly is the Acorn Cottage in White Haven, Pennsylvania. It’s a modified A-Frame that sleeps six. There’s a large deck and two state parks to explore nearby—but you’ll have to bring your own linens and blankets. $117 per night. "
96 apartments in store for Callowhills Heid building,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/21/16339530/heid-building-callowhill-apartments-renderings-prdc-properties,article,"An old hat-making warehouse located just past the Vine Street Expressway in Callowhill is about to become an amenity-driven, mixed-use apartment building. The Heid Building at 323 N. 13th Street used to be the home of Frank P. Heid & Company, which once held the title of being the largest hat- and cap-making company in Philly. But like many other warehouses all throughout the city, this one has been vacant for the past 11 years. That’s all set to change with the announcement that local developer PRDC Properties will be bringing 96 market-rate one- and two-bedroom apartments to the site, with rents ranging from $1,100 to $2,200 a month. It will also be home to a ground-floor restaurant and a roof top amenity level with swinging hammocks, fire pits, a dog park, and an indoor-outdoor kitchen. “We want it so that everyone can live outside of the apartment,” said PRDC Properties president Jon Thomas at Wednesday’s announcement on the fourth floor of the Heid Building. “This building will give you the opportunity to do that.” The project and the apartments will be designed by Shimi Zakin of the local architecture firm Atrium Design Group. But for the building’s actual build out, PRDC Properties will be helped by 20 high school students from Ben Franklin High School’s Career & Technical Education Vocational Center. The partnership, encouraged by City Councilman and real estate magnate Allan Domb, will train students on the job, allowing them to be a part of the construction process at the Heid Building from start to finish. “We think this public-private partnership has the ability to be life-altering,” said PRDC Properties chief operating officer Brandon Morrison to a crowd of students at the announcement. Morrison worked with Domb to put the internship program together.The Heid building adaptive reuse effort is the latest redevelopment project to come to Callowhill, a neighborhood that’s been experiencing a recent renaissance. Its location, within steps of the future Rail Park and a 10-minute walk to Center City, has made the area attractive to developers in recent years.  The move made sense for PRDC Properties, which is known for its luxury home developments (it recently broke ground on a 44-townhome community in Northern Liberties with starting prices at $699,000.). It also led the restoration of the historic Lincoln apartment building in Washington Square West. Mayor Jim Kenney was on hand at the announcement. Keeping his remarks short, he encouraged the students to “be on time” and thanked the developer for preserving the building. Councilman Domb added, “You can’t live in history in any other city like you can in Philly. This is living history.”Construction is expected to begin in November and take 15 months. "
"Exclusive: The Divine Lorraine lobby restored, in before-after photos",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/14/16302348/divine-lorraine-lobby-makeover-photos,article,"It’s been nearly four months since we last checked in on progress at the Divine Lorraine, the iconic building on North Broad that has been undergoing $44 million worth of renovations since 2015. In late May, all that was really left was putting the final touches on the grand lobby. Now, the big reveal is here, with an exclusive first look at the space on Curbed Philly. Tonight, the Divine Lorraine will host a free event from 6 to 9 p.m. with music, drinks, and food to celebrate the completion of the lobby, allowing everyone to see the space and staged units in all their original glory in person.The lobby is one of the two main grand spaces of the Divine Lorraine, the other being the 10th-floor banquet hall that is now home to two bi-level apartments. The Divine Lorraine was designed by Willis G. Hale and built between 1892-94 as an apartment building. It then spent some time as a hotel and in its last iteration, a home for followers of Father Divine. When developer Eric Blumenfeld bought the abandoned building a few years ago  (actually his second time doing so), he brought on Robert Powers of Powers & Company and architect Richard W. Sauder to lead the restoration efforts, with DOMUS heading up construction. Using historical images, the team was able to restore the lobby’s intricate moldings, columns, and marble floors. Here’s how much the lobby has changed from May 2016 to today. But the lobby doesn’t look completely original. The oval desk at the back of the lobby was removed and replaced with two handmade original desks that can be moved around for future events. This area is separated with a new, modern glass wall that separates the residential lobby from the main entrance. The plan is for the wings off each side of the main lobby to be filled by restaurants. The goal, Casella says, was to bring back the original details of the space, while also bringing it to the 21st century. Overall, however, the space leans more on the formal side than the typical modern residential lobbies one sees in new high-rises today. The finished space is no doubt a welcome for the folks who have already moved into their apartments at the Divine Lorraine. To date, 49 of the 101 apartments have been leased. That means since January 2017, the residents have had to walk through a construction zone to get to their apartments. Ed Casella, EB Realty Management’s regional property manager, hopes that number increases in the next week. And after a sluggish August leasing month, Casella says apartment tours and interest in general has already picked up in September. “Hopefully, once people see the lobby is finished, we get even a few more leases signed after this week,” Casella says. The building’s new front double doors may help folks realize that the Divine Lorraine is actually open for business, too. Still, there’s a bit of a ways to go for the Divine Lorraine. Now that the lobby is finished, the restaurant spaces on either side need to be filled. Casella says the team is close to finalizing tenants for the commercial space. Blumenfeld is also working out what will become of the next-door Annex building, whose facade has also been restored. Talks of turning it into a boutique hotel have been considered. When will this all play out? “Soon” seems to be the most the team can offer at this point. “Very soon.” "
"Phillys median rent is on the steady rise, reports say",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/9/5/16240410/philadelphia-median-rent-september-2017,article,"With a new month underway and summer’s typically hot rental season simmering down, it’s time to check on the current status of Philly’s apartment market. As Curbed Philly has shown before, many sites that track rental market data on a monthly basis all have their own methodologies, so their stats should be taken with a grain of salt. But most recent numbers can agree on one thing: Rents continue to increase on at a slow and steady pace here in Philly. Although median rents took a slight dip at the start of 2017, since February they have been on the rise slowly, but surely, according to Apartment List. Multiple reports placed the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the range of $970 to $1,410. For two-bedrooms, the median rent ranges from $1,170 to $1,600. Here’s how September numbers stack up among Apartment List, Zumper, and Adobo. In general, median rents in Philly have increased by 1.9 percent from this time last year, according to Apartment List, the only website of the three that tracks this particular stat. While Philly’s median rent is slightly above the nation’s average, its rental market continues to remain more affordable than other major cities that have experienced much more significant hikes in rent over the past few months. San Francisco’s median rent, for example, is at least two times more than Philly’s monthly median rent. It remains the most priciest rental market in the nation, according to all three rental websites. "
Orinoka Civic House unexpectedly has affordable units still available,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/8/23/16183982/orinoka-civic-house-affordable-housing-leasing,article,"When the Orinoka Civic House in Kensington received more than 650 applicants for its 51 affordable rentals earlier this year, two things were clear: 1) There was a great need for affordable housing in Philly and 2) there would be no trouble filling these rentals. But that was in March. Today, more than a dozen units are still up for grabs at the old factory-turned-mixed-income housing development at 2771-2777 Ruth Street.So what happened? “It was somewhat unexpected,” says Felix Torres-Colon, executive director of New Kensington CDC (NKCDC). “The units for people at 20 percent of the area’s median income (AMI) went right away, but the units for people at around 60 percent have been going slightly slower.”The Orinoka Civic House is a low-income housing tax credit project, which means that potential tenants’ incomes have to match or be able to carry particular rents. In Orinoka’s case, NKCDC has struggled to find renters who meet the 50 to 60 percent income level. So while there’s a 100-person waiting list the 20 percent AMI units, there are still more than a dozen units available for the 50 percent and 60 percent income levels. There are 26 units and 19 units reserved for the 50 and 60 percent income brackets, respectively. Says Torres-Colon, “You have this very narrow window where you have to have enough money to afford the unit, but you can’t have too much. And it’s often very difficult to get someone right there in the middle.”But that’s just one of the potential explanations. The executive director says there are also ongoing misconceptions about what people think when they hear the words “affordable housing.” “They often think you have to be homeless,” says Torres-Colon. “There’s a variety of myths that people have about affordable housing that prevents them from applying. They just say, ‘I make too much money or I don’t make enough.’”Currently, a one-bedroom apartment at Orinoka that rents for $564 a month requires an annual income of at least $16,920. A two-bedroom apartment that rents for $622 requires an income of at least $18,660 annually. The current construction may have kept people from applying, too. Although many tenants have already moved into the Orinoka Civic House, the community area, commercial space, and NKCDC’s own offices are still under construction. Torres-Colon says the project should finish up by late fall. But the apartments themselves are move-in ready. And, he says, the apartments also bucks stereotypes of low-income housing: The units feature finishes like original exposed brick coupled with stainless steel appliances and modern cabinetry. There also also expansive views back toward Center City. Says Torres-Colon, “I think there are a lot of worse places you could live.”"
How Phillys rents have changed from 1968 to today,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/7/21/16004644/philadelphia-average-rent-timeline,article,"It can be tough to keep track of Philly’s rental market, with real estate sites that consistently crunch the numbers offering wide-ranging numbers. Take July, for example. Apartment List placed the median rent of a two-bedroom apartment in Philadelphia at $1,160. Adobo said it’s more like $1,565 a month. Axiometrics puts the average rent at $1,498. No matter what the actual median rent is right now, one thing’s for sure: Renting in Philly doesn’t come cheap these days, with a majority of renters identifying as cost-burdened. And with a majority of new construction in Philly falling on the high end of the market, sky-high rents are becoming the norm. All this recent talk of rising rents in Philly had us wondering about the state of Philly’s rental market long before real estate sites started tracking it on a monthly basis. So in earlier this summer, we turned to you, dear Curbed readers, and poised the question: How much was the rent at your first Philly apartment?Dozens of answers rolled in both in this Open Thread and on Facebook. And we recorded them all here in one handy-dandy timeline, starting from $100 for a University City apartment in 1968(!) to a $1,550 apartment in Washington Square West in 2016. There’s no science to this compilation of reader’s input, of course, but at the very least the timeline shows how much this city and its neighborhoods have changed. Read ‘em and weep, folks."

It has been updated throughout to reflect the latest information.Welcome to the City of Brotherly Love! Maybe you're a student, ready to break out of the dorms and out on your own. Maybe you're just starting out in a new job, just out of college or grad school, or a seasoned professional with two kids and a pug in tow. Whoever you are, here's a guide to renting in Philadelphia, from finding your digs, to insuring them (yes, you should get renter's insurance) to making yourself at home. Got anything to add? Hit up the comments, or our tipline. Happy apartment hunting!It is not an exaggeration to say that Philadelphians take where they live very, very seriously. We're an aggressively neighborhood-centric bunch, and choosing your neighborhood is right on par with choosing your actual apartment. Whether you’re local or out of town, a good first step is to take our fun personality quiz to help determine what Philly neighborhood speaks to you. Then, if you’re able to, grab a bike, or throw on your walking shoes. Walk around a few blocks. Look for amenities like grocery stores, bus stops, liquor stores, and schools. What's within walking distance? Do the people sitting on their stoop look up and say hello, or stick their chin into their chests when you walk by? Could you see yourself walking these streets every single day on your commute? If no, keep searching. Also, don't be discouraged if after a few months you've discovered that your neighborhood is too posh/grungy/hipster/yuppie for you. This is why you're renting. Finish up your lease and move on.Philly’s real estate market is white hot and housing inventory is at a record low. Couple that with the residential building boom underway, and that can mean one thing: Increasingly high rental prices. Still, average monthly rents are all over place, depending at what rental site you look at. For example, a one-bedroom can fetch anywhere from less than a grand to more than $3,000, depending on the neighborhood. Spend a few days/weeks browsing rental sites (we've listed a few, below) to get your finger on the pulse of where the rental market is, and don't be afraid to ask friends what they are spending on their crib. Long gone are the days when a little yellow box at the corner of the street would deliver a comprehensive list of apartment pickings into your hands every Wednesday morning. Now you have a bevy of rental websites at your disposal, each promising the best of what Philly has to offer. The truth? Not one of them does—they all do, collectively. So browse a few to get the lay of the land and see which one has a user interface that works best for you.For your convenience, we've created this handy-dandy map of a few dozen of the best and newest apartment buildings in Philly. From keeping the heat at a minimum of 68 degrees during winter months to making sure your toilet flushes, your landlord has a litany of items he or she needs to check off every month to make sure you're snug as a bug in a rug. Check out Curbed's post on legal requirements for rental properties here, and if you have an issue with your landlord, your first point of contact should be with the City's Department of Licenses and Inspections, whom you can reach here, or at their super-responsive Twitter handle, @Philly311.And that means many of its rentals are aging. So you’ll definitely want to run through this check list when touring an apartment and receive official confirmation that the rental is free of lead paint. Ah, the security deposit. That seemingly-astronomical sum you pay your landlord once you've signed your rental contract that compensates your landlord in case you decide to superglue your furniture to the ceiling or something. Save your pennies, because under Pennsylvania landlord-tenant law, a landlord may charge a tenant the equivalent of two months' rent for the security deposit for the first year of renting and the equivalent of one month's rent during all subsequent years of renting. But if you and your landlord both play by the books, you'll see that money returned to you when you end your lease.While the list of things your landlord is responsible for is extensive, replacing your TV in case of a leaky roof or fire is not one of them. Do you have car insurance? Call your insurance company to have them tack on a renter's insurance policy, sometimes for as little as $10 or even less a month. Bundling is probably the most inexpensive and convenient way to give you peace of mind should an Act of God happen. It's not much—really."
First Look: Inside the 16-story Vue32 residential tower in University City,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/30/15892664/vue32-apartments-photos-tour,article,"All it takes is one look from the rooftop terrace of Vue32 to understand how the 16-story tower got its name. “I think it has one of the best views of downtown Philly,” said developer David Yeager of Radnor Property Group at a recent hard hat tour of the tower.He’s not wrong—although it’s also a telling view of not just Center City’s evolving skyline, but University City’s ongoing rise, too. At 16 stories, one wouldn’t expect Vue32 to offer the same jaw-dropping vistas as, say, the 47-story FMC Tower on the Schuylkill. But its location at 3201 Race Street places it high above the SEPTA rail yard and allows it unblocked views of the rest of the city. It’s what attracted Radnor Property Group to the site. And according to Yeager, 60 percent of the 164 units in Vue32 have views of Center City. Construction began on the $56 million tower (it was originally called View32 until it underwent a rebranding) in March 2016. But that was after months of community meetings and the city’s approval of 14 zoning variances for the project. To accommodate the requests of both neighbors and Drexel University, which is a partner in the project with Radnor Property Group, local architecture firm Erdy McHenry ultimately designed a tower that was slimmer, taller, and slightly rotated east. This positioning helps minimize shadow lines across the neighborhood’s adjacent community garden. It also creates an 11-foot grade change from west to east that allows for handsome stadium seating and a plaza at the foot of the building’s main entrance. In addition, parking for 32 spaces was moved underground, and an 180-person early learning childcare center was reserved for the lower two floors. The building’s smaller footprint—Yeager describes it as a boutique apartment building—means the studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom units are on the smaller size than the average apartment, though they all have nine-foot-tall ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. The units range in price from $1,700 for a 494-square-foot junior one-bedroom unit to $5,100 for a 1,495-square-foot three-bedroom. Yeager says in general the units are 5 percent smaller than apartments at Radnor’s other University City project at 3737 Chestnut. At last count, about 15 to 20 percent of the units have been leased. As expected, they seem to be attracting eds and meds of University City, although Yeager notes that some young professionals who reverse commute out of Philly have expressed interest, due to Vue32’s proximity to 30th Street Station. The story isn’t over for the project. The second phase, which will bring 12 two-bedroom condos next to the tower, is set to break ground later this summer. "
"Only rental in new One Riverside tower wants $4,800/month",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/27/15879268/one-riverside-condo-philadelphia-rental,article,"A swanky two-bedroom rental on the 14th floor of the new One Riverside condo tower is up for grabs—for $4,800 a month. Not only is it one of the priciest rentals around, but it’s one of the first and only rentals available in the 18-story condo tower, which only recently started moving in homeowners earlier this spring. At the time, 80 percent of the 68 units in the Fitler Square high-rise, developed by Carl Dranoff, had sold. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is 1,028 square feet and features 10-foot ceilings. Unlike most of the condo units here, it doesn’t have outdoor space, but there is a Juliet balcony. The future renter of this unit will be living among condo owners, but will still have access to all of the same amenities, like the indoor lap pool, gym, and multiple community spaces on the ground floor. Suffering from sticker shock? Consider the five most expensive rentals on the market in Philly right now, with the “cheapest” apartment asking $8,200 a month. "
First Look: Inside the new West Lofts at the old West Philadelphia High School,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/23/15854830/west-philadelphia-high-school-loft-apartments-photos,article,"In less than 10 days, the Gothic Revival behemoth known as the original West Philadelphia High School will reopen its doors as West Lofts. Forget that the marble floors and walls are still covered in dust, or that the lobby and common spaces are still a work in progress. The tenants of the first 35 units are more than ready to be a part of the grand building’s return to West Philly. “It’s been overwhelming, to say the least,” said project coordinator Mariah Frazier. “We were expecting the first people to trickle in for tours. But we had 180 tours scheduled in first week. It was like a competition of people trying to get in.”The first 35 available units have been leased for July 1 move-ins. As of June 20, only six units were still available in the second August move-in phase. And 60 percent of the units available for September move-ins have been leased.In total, there will be 268 market-rate apartments at West Lofts, ranging from $995 for studios to up to $2,430 for 3-bedroom units. The 1-, 2-, and 3-bedrooms are bi-level and all of the building’s hardwood floors have been refinished. Frazier also revealed that the school’s grand auditorium will be converted in coworking space and a coffee shop will both open up in the fall. The building’s own management, the Galman Group, will run the coworking space, which will help keep the leasing costs low for future tenants. It’s been a long road to get to this point. The late Gothic revival high school was built in 1912, and, along with dozens of other city public schools, was shuttered in 2011. Students moved to another, newer building a few blocks away, while the former school, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, sat abandoned. Developer and owner Andrew Bank of Strong Place Partners bought the massive property in 2016. Like most residents of the Walnut Hill and surrounding West Philly neighborhoods, Bank had strong ties to the school: His grandmother attended West Philadelphia High School.But within days of purchasing the school, the property was vandalized inside and tagged with graffiti. Much of the restoration work in the beginning involved making repairs following the break-in, according to Frazier. Otherwise, the school was in relatively good shape since closing in 2011. Given the building’s historical significance and his own personal ties to the school, it was important for Bank to restore as many original details of the school as possible. The original gym and its indoor track will be restored and open to residents by late July. Meanwhile, the building’s original heating room on the first floor will be converted into the communal space.Frazier says it’s been a labor of love for the past year at the new West Lofts. In fact, some of its future residents are alumni of West Philadelphia High School. “I just can’t imagine what it’d be like going to school here and then living here,” said Frazier. “But everybody is so into the vibes of the building.” "
1213 Walnut update: 26-story tower now pre-leasing for August move-ins,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/20/15836380/fergie-tower-1213-walnut-philadelphia-leasing-information,article,"After topping out in January at 285 feet, the 26-story tower 1213 Walnut has started pre-leasing its 322 luxury apartments and is expected to be ready for early August move-ins. Curbed Philly recently got a sneak peek of the tower in Washington Square West (the real estate and development world refers to this area as Midtown Village). While the 300,000-square-foot tower is still very much a construction zone, Todd Malligan, Goldenberg Group’s vice president of construction and development, says everything is on track for the first tenants to move in by the end of July or early August and for construction to finish up by late summer or early fall. “We really just have cosmetic work to do,” Malligan said. 1213 Walnut, often referred to as the “Fergie Tower” due to its proximity to the Fergie Pub on Sansom Street, broke ground in December 2015 and topped out in January 2016. The tower is by far the tallest building on the block. Malligan says that’s why a large retail presence both on Walnut and Sansom streets was important. “The neighborhood is really the building’s best amenity, so we wanted to engage the neighborhood by keeping activity on the street,” he said. Indeed, the first two stories of the tower on Walnut Street will consist of a 6,000-square-foot restaurant. Malligan says the tenant is still to be determined. Above the restaurant is a community terrace for residents of 1213 Walnut. The project also includes a covered driveway from Walnut to Sansom Street, which will be accented by a CorTen steel wall with planters and accessible to the public.   The entrance to the residential building will be on this side street, as well. Malligan says one idea for the covered street is to close it to traffic and host the occasional block party. The residential portion of 1213 Walnut features a wealth of amenities, including a fireplace in the two-story lobby, and an amenity level that takes up the entire second floor of the building and features wood accents throughout made of, fittingly, Walnut. On that level, there will be three community outdoor spaces (there are four total in the building), including one for the fitness center, a dog run, and the community terrace fronting Walnut Street. The 322 apartments include studios, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom units that range in price from $1,819 for a 433-square-foot studio to $3,604 for an 830-square-foot two-bedroom rental. The 25th floor will include penthouse units with terraces facing both east and west. The hard hat tour of recently finished model units revealed floor-to-ceiling windows, and the option for residents to choose between two different interior finishes: One offers darker Italian-crafted cabinetry and flooring than the other. But of all of the high-end features and amenities at the tower, perhaps the most telling one is that the project does not include parking, although some residents will have access to the Parkway Parking garage next door. That move was purposeful for Goldenberg Group and Hines Development, who from the beginning marketed 1213 Walnut as a walkable mixed-use project. Indeed, the December 2015 groundbreaking opted out of the traditional shovel-to-ground ceremony and instead installed bike racks along Sansom Street.“Once upon a time, not having a parking garage with a project of this size was a non-starter,” Malligan said. “But we have to evolve with the urban renter professional and create spaces that can evolve. We wanted to reflect the persona of the neighborhood.” "
10 things to do when you look at a rental in Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/19/15830000/philly-rental-property-inspection-checklist,article,"Editor’s note: This article was originally published in November 2012 and has been updated with the most recent information.Real estate agents are good communicators, and when they're working with renters, who are often on a time-sensitive mission and have looser standards than buyers, they know how to work it. Our advice? First and foremost, don't get distracted by the chitchat. Some of the things we suggest are going to sound ridiculously nit-picky. But you can tell a lot about your landlord just by looking at small things—the doorknobs, for instance. Are they jiggly? How about the switch plates? Do they have specks of paint on them? Every square inch of that property says something about your landlord's pride of place—or lack thereof. It also tells you who they think they're renting to; if certain things aren't done, that's because they know their renters generally don't care if it's done. If the answers aren't convincing or the place is a wreck, don't listen to the reassurances that the defects are just temporary. A really good landlord won't show a property in poor condition. They may show it while it's being renovated, but if sawdust isn't the issue—if it just looks like a dump—move on. Otherwise you're going to end up sending us a rental horror story one day.What you're looking for when you check a place out are signs of infestation. We know there's going to be that one evil water bug in your tub every summer that makes you want to never shower again. But if you open a fridge, cabinet, or oven and more than one cockroach comes scuttling out, don't take the place. If you're more flexible on the subject of roaches, just make sure the landlord bombs the heck out of the place before you move in. Philadelphia also has problems with mice, so look for mouse poop. You'll most likely see it on the surfaces in the kitchen, in the corners of the rooms or in the closets, where they like to nest. Really take a good look; the poops can be as small as poppy seeds. Make sure there are smoke detectors and fire extinguishers and a building-wide fire alarm. If you don't see this stuff, the landlord is not in compliance. Be perfectly quiet and see if you can hear your neighbors/cars driving by/trains/any other aggravating noises that might turn up. Ask how old the house is and how thin the walls are. Turn on the faucets. Make sure the water comes out cleanly (not brown) and that the faucets turn off without leaking. Check the water pressure in the bathroom and flush the toilet.If you're going to be living above someone, walk around the whole apartment to see if the floor is squeaky. If it is, know that you'll have to buy rugs and factor that into your cost.  Take a look at the way the place has been painted. Are there swipes of paint that have been left on the windows? Was it a sloppy job? This will tell you something about the kind of people the landlord hires to do work for them. Speaking of paint, if the rental is old (built before 1978), make sure the landlord has a lead paint certificate that assures you as a tenant that the property is lead safe). Open and close each of the windows. Check to see if there are screens and storm windows. See if there are drafts.Do a little sniffing. Do you smell gas? Sewage? Try it in each room (it's okay to be subtle with this one). Turn on the burners, check the freezer, turn on the oven—make sure the appliances work. Check the locks. Is there a deadbolt? What kind of deadbolt—the legal kind or illegal (double-keyed deadbolts are against the fire code). Are there bars on the windows if it's a first floor? Do you need bars? Is that something they'll do? Make sure you're comfortable with the level of security.Have any other tips? Add them in the comments. And remember, don't rely on verbal agreements. S Anything you want a property owner to do, get it in writing in the lease before you sign (you might consider taking photos during your tour, too). You'll be really glad you did later on."
Phillys five most expensive rentals on the market right now,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/7/15753596/philadelphia-most-expensive-apartments-rent,article,"Welcome back to Curbed Comparisons, a dive into the options available for a certain price point in various Philly neighborhoods. In this week’s special edition, we’re taking a look at the priciest rentals on the market right now. Is one person's loft another person’s townhouse? Let's find out! Rittenhouse Square (3 bedrooms, 4.5 baths)—For a staggering $19,500 a month, you can live in the penthouse at the Alison. The terrace that overlooks the square is 2,144-square-feet alone, and the unit in total is 3,755 square feet of high-class space. Did we mention that the terrace has a hot tub and built-in grill? Logan Square (4 beds, 5 baths)—The second priciest rental is located in a recently built condo complex in Logan Square. At 5,000 square feet, it offers more space than the Rittenhouse penthouse at a “cheaper” price tag of $14,900 a month. Some jaw-dropping perks include: An elevator, roof deck, a walk-in closet with a chandelier, and an electric car-charging station. But at that price, there’s no word on pets.  Society Hill (4 beds, 4 baths)—For a more traditional style of living, here’s a Society Hill townhouse that’s renting for $10,500 a month. That chunk of change earns you a 4,150-square-foot rental complete with an elevator and two-car garage. There are also two outdoor spaces, including a patio terrace and a cozy deck off the upper level with views of the Ben Franklin Bridge. You’ll have to look elsewhere if you have pets for roommates; no dogs or cats allowed. Washington Square West (3 beds, 2 baths)—Unit #10C in the renovated Western Union Building wants someone to live in here for $9,999 a month. The 1,920-square-foot unit’s real showstopper is its private 1,500-square-foot wrap-around porch (and for what it’s worth, it already comes furnished). The rental was also designed by local and noted architect Cecil Baker, and it’s located right across the street from the ever-charming Quince Street. Center City (3 beds, 3.5 baths)—Rounding out the list is this 2,046-square-foot corner condo in the swanky Residences at the Ritz-Carlton. Located on the 25th floor, it’ll definitely offer some of the biggest views out of all of the units on this list, including an up-close shot of Billy Penn atop City Hall. There’s outdoor space and access to the building’s flashy amenities. Oh, and the entire condo comes furnished. Consider it part of the $8,200 monthly rent. "
"Check out the Pyramids restored facade, in before-after photos",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/6/5/15739576/pyramid-building-brewerytown-restored-facade-photos,article,"On the edge of Brewerytown and Fairmount Park, there are no signs of slowing down at the historic Pyramid building, where the graffiti-laden exterior is gone, replaced with a fresh coat of paint, repointed brick, and brand new windows. And people are starting to notice. About one month ahead of the first round of July 10 move-ins, the Pyramid Lofts, as it’s now being called, is already 66 percent leased; all one-bedroom units have been rented. It’s bucking the current trend of the rental market in Philly, where a number of developments are experiencing a lag in leases. Project manager David Glassner suspects that has to do with the low rental rates at the Pyramid Lofts. The 50 units, a mix of studios, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom units, range from $960 to about $2,450. Glassner says the “rental rates wouldn’t have been feasible without the use of historic tax credits,” on the project. The triangular-shaped behemoth on a hill has sat vacant for 15 years at 3101 W. Glenwood Avenue, becoming an underground community for graffiti artists. But it dates back to 1922, when it was designed by architect Leroy B. Rothschild as a furniture warehouse for Harry C. Kahn & Sons. When that company closed up shop, Pyramid Electric Supply Company moved in during the 1960s. Developer MMPartners bought the property one year ago and immediately began work to convert the warehouse into apartments. Curbed Philly recently checked in on the Pyramid Lofts’ progress since its last visit in March. In the last three months, the building’s facade has been restored and is close to completion; a new, custom-made sign that reads “Pyramid Lofts” will eventually stretch across the west-facing facade.Here’s the east-facing facade in March versus today. About $1.3 million in federal and state tax credits went toward replacing every single window with original glass fit-outs.Glassner says it hasn’t been decided if the graffiti-laden doors will be kept or repurposed in some way with the project. Inside, numerous works by graffiti artists have been preserved throughout. To the left of the building in this photo will be a gated parking lot for 31 spaces, as well as a small dog-run and bike storage room. There will also be access to the building’s ground-floor commercial retail, which is still under negotiations. There’s a public open house of the Pyramid Lofts on Thursday, June 8. "

"At the Divine Lorraine, the grand lobbys return awaits",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/23/15676118/divine-lorraine-renovations-before-after-photos,article,"At the Divine Lorraine on North Broad, the two iconic lights atop the apartment building have been shining since November, and residents have been moving into their new homes in the historic building since January 1. Now, all that’s really left for the $44 million restoration project is the return of its grand lobby. “People are ready for the lobby to be finished,” property manager Ed Casella said during a recent visit to the Divine Lorraine, which was designed by Willis G. Hale and originally opened in 1884 as apartments. “They’ve been super supportive of the process, but we’ve really tried to curtail the presence of construction because this is now a place where people actually live.” Indeed, the last time we checked in on the Divine Lorraine’s status was in January, when EB Realty and TCS Management were making a big push to rent the remaining units. At Casella’s most recent count, 35 of the 101 units have been rented, with a surprising amount of tenants who are from out of town. “We’re poised to have an extremely productive May, June, and July leasing season,” Casella remarked. Here’s how the lobby and facade of the Divine Lorraine have drastically changed over the past year. The before photos were taken in May 2016. In December 2016, the north-facing and front facade of the Divine Lorraine were unveiled looking nearly brand new. Now, all of the scaffolding has been removed from the south-facing side, exposing the full facade of the stone building and the annex. The plan to turn the annex into a boutique hotel is still being worked out, according to Casella.The plaster work in the Divine Lorraine’s lobby is expected to be finished in three to four weeks, Casella said. A wall made of windows and wood will be added to the center of the lobby, separating the residents’ front desk area from the commercial space in the front. CBRE is still in the process of finalizing commercial tenants, which will set up shop on the left and right of the lobby. “We’ve been regularly showing the commercial spaces and are really confident we’ll hit a home run soon,” said Casella, going on to acknowledge that the lobby’s current state may have played a role in the wait. “I think a lot of people are waiting on the lobby to see how their business will fit into the plan.”The handrails and spindles along the winding staircases were completely remade. The historic preservation efforts have been led by Powers & Company and architect Richard W. Sauder. As Curbed Philly noted before, the original front desk was removed and will be replaced by two oval, custom-made desks, complemented with a new chandelier hanging above. Behind the desks will be an ADA door entrance.  One of the units on the 10th floor is a bi-level, two-bedroom apartment that was originally part of the building’s grand hall. Although the immense space was broken into apartments, the design kept the cathedral ceilings intact. This corner unit—one of the most expensive in the building at $3,000-plus/month—has three walls of windows that have views spanning from the Ben Franklin Bridge to Center City to North Philly.  "
The Beury Building on North Broad is now leasing,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/5/17/15653164/beury-building-leasing-floor-plans-national-bank-north-philadelphia,article,"After 40 years of abandonment, the return of the iconic Beury building on North Broad is official—now it needs people to fill its space. Developer Shift Capital has announced that it is actively looking for tenants to lease more than 11,000-square-feet of space in the Art Deco behemoth on North Broad and Erie Avenue. It’s the latest development for the much-anticipated rebirth of the Beury building, which dates back to 1926 when it served as the headquarters for the National Bank of North Philadelphia. The 14-story structure was designed by William Harold Lee and was considered an Art Deco masterpiece. But like many other North Broad buildings, the Beury’s state has declined significantly since it was abandoned, left to the same graffiti-laden fate as the Divine Lorraine. Shift Capital’s plans hope to revive the building, and call for 62 one-bedroom units and commercial space built out during the first phase. The second phase includes the construction of an annex, which will add 10,000 square feet of retail, 100,000 square feet of commercial space, and up to 80 residential units. Construction on the first phase of the project is expected to begin at the end of 2017 and be ready for occupancy in spring 2019. There are multiple spaces available for lease on the first, second, and 11th floors. Here are some floor plans and renderings that Shift Capital shared with Curbed Philly. The floor plan reveals that there will be an outdoor terrace on the 11th floor. "
West Philadelphia High School apartments prep for summer move-ins,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/4/26/15422414/west-lofts-philadelphia-rent-prices-renderings,article,"It’s been some time since we checked in on progress at the conversion of the historic West Philadelphia High School into apartments. But we now know that some of the units will be move-in ready by this June—and based on the renderings, the so-called “West Lofts” are going to be pretty great. Galman Group, which is handling the building’s management, told Curbed Philly that the finishing touches are being made to the model units and showings and leasing should begin the first week of May. Move-ins are expected to begin in June. It’s been a long road to this point for West Philadelphia High School. The late Gothic revival high school was built in 1912, and, along with dozens of other city public schools, closed its doors in 2011. Students moved to another, newer building a few blocks away, while the former school, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, sat abandoned for years. Today, it’s reborn as West Lofts, and will feature 268 apartments, ranging from studio to 3-bedroom units. The 1-, 2-, and 3-bedrooms are bi-level and all of the building’s hardwood floors have been refinished. The lofts are being built out in phases and by floor. The first apartments offered for lease will be located on the second floor. Curbed Philly was also told that the gym is likely to be “one of the coolest features” at West Lofts. The raised indoor track was preserved and fully restored. The units prices seem pretty standard and range from $995 for a studio up to $2,430 for a 3-bedroom unit. You can ogle over the sweet renderings and floor plans below. "
Historic Lincoln building reborn as apartments in Washington Square West,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/28/15074938/lincoln-building-locust-philadelphia-renovations,article,"Like so many old buildings in Philadelphia, the Lincoln in Washington Square West has a long and storied past. In its many lives, the 125-year-old building at 1222 Locust has served as a hotel, a YWCA, a flophouse, even a seedy night club. Today, in a quite literal “rising from the ashes” kind of story, the Lincoln, designed by George H. Fettus in 1892, is onto its next and hopefully final role, officially opening at the start of 2017 as a 44-unit luxury apartment building. The grand opening in January was a welcome return for the historic building, which had sat boarded up for years after a major fire ravaged its interiors in 2006, leaving a shell of a building on the corner of Camac and Locust. In 2014, just two days from its impending demolition, local developer PRDC Properties managed to acquire the property for $1.8 million. They worked with Powers & Company, Inc. to restore the building’s certified historic exterior, bringing the brick facade and terra-cotta trim back to life. A sixth floor was added, as well as a community roof deck. For the apartment build outs, the developer brought on Shimi Zakin of the local architecture firm Atrium Design Group, who’s known for his high-end, custom luxury residential work. PRDC Properties president Jon Thomas likes to describe the apartments as having experienced the “Shimi Effect.” “He just knows his finishes and we jive really well with his design aesthetic,” adds Brandon Morrison, PRDC’s chief operating officer. There are 44 units total, including a mix of studio, 1-, and 2-bedrooms, plus one 3-bedroom unit with wide-plank oak floors. For the smaller units, Zakin added space-saving details like quartz counters with a waterfall effect that double as eat-in kitchens. The kitchen cabinetry are by Porcelanosa, and the bedroom closets can be customized by each tenant. It’s clear that the units take on a more luxurious bent than an average apartment buildings. Thomas said the intention was “build the apartments like we do our luxury homes.” That allows the rents to remain competitive at the Lincoln, ranging from $1,600 for a junior suite to $2,050 for a 1-bedroom unit to $2,800 for a 2-bedroom.As of the end of January 2017, the Lincoln was 50 percent leased. It’s attracted a hodge-podge mix of tenants, from millennials to med students to older residents, according to Thomas. In total, the project took two years and six months to complete and cost $15 million. Given the deteriorated state of the building that they inherited, renovations took a few months longer than planned, says Thomas. But the extension means the Lincoln’s return comes at a time in Philly when construction cranes and new builds continue to rise up all around it. So as the final finishes are added to the last couple of apartments at 1222 Locust, Thomas says, “In the end, this was just all about good timing.” "
Charming Germantown 4BR twin wants $165K,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/10/14881242/germantown-home-for-sale,article,"After spending some time as a duplex, this renovated Germantown twin has hit the market for less than $200,000, a price point that we think most house-hunters could get on board with. The 4-bedroom, 2-bath home clocks in at 1,773 square feet and has an asking price of $165,900. That comes out to just $93 per square foot.Even better: The seller has already put a lot of elbow grease into the property. In recent years the home was set up as a duplex. It’s now been converted back into a single-family home, undergoing a number of much-needed upgrades in the process. The once-carpeted floors now feature the original hardwood, and the kitchen has been moved to the back of the home, making way for a dining room. Overall, the renovation seems to have brought back to life the home’s original character. The location at 83 West Washington Lane also puts you close to Wissahickon Valley Park and within walking distance of the Upsal train station on the Chestnut Hill West regional Septa line. It’s worth pointing out that the home is also available for rent, asking $1,450/month. "
Orinoka Civic House receives more than 600 applications for 51 affordable rentals,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/3/14800726/orinoka-civic-house-affordable-housing-applications-lottery,article,"A new affordable housing development in Kensington has received more than 600 applications for 51 available units, New Kensington Community Development Corporation (NKCDC) announced yesterday. That’s almost 12 applications per available apartment at the Orinoka Civic House, a telling sign of the state of affordable housing availability in Philly, said Sandy Salzman, NKCDC’s executive director. “We are so proud to be able to provide 51 new units of safe, affordable rental housing,” Salzman said in a statement. “At the same time, the staggering response is a sad reminder of the gap between the real need for housing in this city and the ability of organizations like ours to meet that need.”The city lost 20 percent of low-cost rental units between 2000 and 2014, according to a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. And the affordable housing restrictions that remain are set to expire within the next five years. The NKCDC and the Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations made the announcement ahead of Mayor Jim Kenney’s budget address yesterday, urging him to double the budget of the Philadelphia Housing Trust Fund (HTF). In 2017, the HTF was budgeted for $23.5 million. Kenney’s proposed 2018 budget increased the HTF funding slightly to $27.5 million.The Orinoka Civic House at 2771-2777 Ruth Street was a former abandoned warehouse, originally home to Orinoka Mills. When the $17.8 million adaptive reuse project opens this June, the Orinoka Civic House will feature 1- and 2-bedroom apartments for low- to moderate-income earners, the new headquarters for NKCDC, and 7,200 square feet of commercial and retail space.Given the overwhelming number of interested renters, the NKCDC will host a lottery  today, Friday, March 3, to determine which applicants will receive the first interviews for the apartments. The lottery draw is at 2 p.m. at Coral Street Arts House (2446-68 Coral Street). "
East Markets second 20-story tower secures $57M construction loan,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/3/1/14776898/east-market-second-residential-tower-construction-loan,article,"A $57 million construction loan has been secured to begin construction on the second, taller residential tower at East Market. National Real Estate Development announced today that Wells Fargo will finance construction of the 20-story, 240-unit tower. Work on the building’s two-story retail base, which will include Iron Hill Brewery, has already begun at 1199 Ludlow.It’s the second loan that Wells Fargo has provided for the massive $600 million East Market project. It first loaned $38.5 million for the construction of 1100 Ludlow, an office building that will house Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, the Design Center, and Mom’s Organic Market.Designed by Morris Adjimi and BLT Architects, 1199 Ludlow will be slightly different from the first 17-story residential tower, the Ludlow, which topped off late last year and will include 322 units. The second tower will be slightly taller and offer fewer 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom units, allowing more square footage per apartment. Like its counterpart, there will be perks like a fitness center, conference rooms, and outdoor space. But it does have a slightly longer list of amenities: From the sounds of it, the second tower will be geared more toward established professionals, couples, and families, while the Ludlow has been marketed toward millennials. The second tower is expected to begin leasing in summer 2018 and be move-in ready by the fall. "
Post Brothers begin work on 4th and final tower at Presidential City,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/28/14756582/presidential-city-post-brothers-renovations-philippe-maidenberg,article,"Renovations on the fourth and final tower at Presidential City are underway, with developer Post Brothers working with French architect Philippe Maidenberg to design the lobby, lounge, and model apartments. It will be Maidenberg’s first U.S.-based project. The architect’s Paris-based firm focuses on hotel design, often inserting playful and colorful details into his projects. The same can be said of the proposed designs for the Adams, the fourth tower at Presidential City. Maidenberg re-designed the tower’s dated lobby, incorporating modern finishes and furniture with the building’s original details. Like the other three residential towers, the fourth is named after a U.S. president. The original intention of Presidential City’s developer John McShain in 1950 was to build 48 towers that would be named after all of the presidents. He only managed to build the Washington, Madison, Adams, and Jefferson before selling the rest of the land.Post Brothers bought the property on the edge of Philly near Bala Cynwyd in 2012 for $80 million, and began renovations in 2014. They’re finishing up renovations on the third tower, the Jefferson, and will finish up on the Adams by the end of this year. Here’s how the current, dated lobby will look after the renovations. When the $100 million renovation project is completed this year, it will be the largest residential redevelopment project in Philadelphia. There are a total of 1,000 units—ranging from $1,000 to $4,500 a month—in the community that will have been updated."
Rehabbed Orinoka Civic House in Kensington is now leasing,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/2/3/14487234/orinoka-civic-house-kensington-leasing-information,article,"The story of how Orinoka Mills, a large factory building just a block from Somerset station, went from boom to bust is not an uncommon one for Philadelphia. It goes like this: Textile factory thrives during the city’s “Workshop of the World” era. The industrial boom goes bust. Textile company ships out to the suburbs. The abandoned factory becomes a big source of blight. More specifically, when the Solomon Brothers of Orinoka Mills finally ditched their Kensington headquarters in the 1980s, the factory stood abandoned at Somerset and Ruth streets for nearly 40 years, decaying day by day while earning the reputation of a notorious drug corner and a shooting gallery. “It was an eyesore,” recalled Kevin Gray, New Kensington Community Development Corporations’s real estate development director. “It served as a cover for illicit activity and drugs. It was a really bad spot on the neighborhood and residents were really concerned.”But this is the story of the factory’s second chapter beginning this June, when it reopens as an affordable civic house and attempts to wipe away its four decades of abandonment and neglect. Under its new name the Orinoka Civic House, the adaptive reuse project will feature 51 apartments for low- to moderate-income earners, the new headquarters for NKCDC, and 7,200 square feet of commercial and retail space. The almost-finished $17.8 million project is the result of a long list of partners and funders, including community stakeholders and the Philadelphia Housing Authority, with NKCDC taking the lead. The non-profit organization saw the potential in the building’s redevelopment and what it could do for the neighborhood, which until a few years ago they hadn’t had the manpower to address.  NKCDC covers a huge swath of land around Kensington, stretching from Front Street to the west, Kensington Avenue to the northwest, Frankford Creek to the northeast, and the Delaware River border.“It can be rather difficult to make an impact on an area if you’re too scattered,” explained Gray. “So we put it on ourselves to try to do something with the building after working with city to a acquire it. The idea was to create a catalyst for the neighborhood.” With that goal in mind, NKCDC came up with the idea of turning the factory into a civic house, a space that would encourage civic engagement with the community rather than apart from the community. Says Gray, “It was the idea that Orinoka would be giving people the voice and power to think about their neighborhood and support their neighborhood. That’s the ethos behind it.”In June 2014, NKCDC announced its plans for the building, working with local architecture firm Jibe Design for the rehab of the old factory. They opted for a glass, transparent frontage to encourage both residents and neighbors to engage with the building. In October 2015, the project broke ground and by March 2016 the NKCDC officially became owners of the property, which was transferred from the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development. Today, the affordable housing apartments are nearing the end of construction and now leasing, scheduled to be move-in ready by June 2017. Work on the NKCDC offices and retail on the ground-level will follow soon after. But in order for the concept of the Orinoka Civic House to work, they of course need people to live there. Gray says all potential renters are welcome, but ideally, future tenants would want to be part of and live within a civic-minded community. The same hope goes for the future tenant of the retail and commercial space. Gray says they have been talking to a couple of potential entrepreneurs and local business owners. “We’re confident we’d like to have someone who is community-minded, in tune with the income levels, and able to provide an amenity that won’t already exist at Orinoka.” There is no set rent on the 30 1-bedroom and 21 2-bedroom units, as the prices will be adjusted for household income, which is capped at the 60 percent of the area’s median income. As of right now, the upper income limit for a family of four is $48,180, according to Gray. There are still four months to go until Orinoka Civic House welcomes its new community. But, says Gray, that feels like no time at all considering how long it took to get to this point.The encouraging thing about the project is that its mission, to foster a civic-minded community, has already been put in place to get this project off the ground. “So many people from the city, local residents—everyone made really great effort on many parts,” said Gray. “We’re so thankful.” "
Divine Lorraine to host open house for last remaining units,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/27/14412844/divine-lorraine-open-house-tour,article,"It may be hard to believe, but people have been living in the newly restored Divine Lorraine for nearly a month, after the first tenants moved in January 1. As of right now, TCS Management tells Curbed Philly that nearly half of the 101 apartments have been leased, and 55 units are still available.That’s why Eric Blumenfeld’s team is hosting an open house for potential renters on Saturday, February 4 from 12 to 3 p.m. Yup, this is your rare chance to go inside the historic Divine Lorraine, which aside from the apartments, is still very much a construction zone as the lobby and rest of the building undergoes restoration. (The restaurant tenants for the lobby and basement levels have not yet been announced.) Here’s what you can expect at the open house: Tours of the units—they range from 1- and 2-bedrooms—as well as a free lunch. The remaining units start at $1,400, but the open house is waiving application fees and is offering a discounted security deposit of $750 (Typically, it’s a full month’s rent.). There’s also the option to sign up for a longer lease at a locked-in rental rate. Here’s a sampling of floor plans to peruse over before the open house at 699 N. Broad Street."
"1213 Walnut, aka Fergie Tower, tops out at 285 feet",https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/24/14370898/1213-walnut-tower-topped-out-philadelphia,article,"The 1213 Walnut tower, known to many as the Fergie Tower due to its neighboring pub, has officially topped out. Developers Goldenberg Group and Hines Development announced that the 26-story tower topped out on January 10, reaching its full height of 285 feet. Now, construction crews are finishing up the facade installation and have moved indoors to begin building up the 322 luxury units. The apartments are expected to begin leasing in April and be move-in ready by July. The website has little information on the individual units, and rental pricing has not been announced. It’s been a little over a year since 1213 Walnut broke ground in December 2015, and the tower has risen quickly concrete pour after concrete pour. When construction finishes up this summer, the tower will feature 7,200 square feet of retail along Walnut and Sansom (next to Fergie’s Pub), and a long list of amenities on the upper levels, including a rooftop deck, elevated dog park, and indoor-outdoor fitness center. It’s also going to be one of the first residential towers of its kind without a parking garage for residents, emphasizing its lean towards tenants who prefer walking or biking. For what it’s worth, there is parking garage next door. "
Sneak Peek: Inside the Bridge by Gluck+ in Old City,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/17/14268452/photos-bridge-apartments-gluck-old-city,article,"For Jeffrey Brown, May 2017 can’t come soon enough. That’s the tentative move-in date for future tenants of the Bridge, a mixed-use, mixed-income development in Old City that’s been on the rise since breaking ground in 2015. But for Brown, of Brown Hill Development and Jeffrey Brown Associates, this project has been about 15 years in the making. Brown bought the land at 205 Race Street in 2000, not because he had some grand vision for the site, but because, as he puts it, “it was just available.” Little did he know how long he’d have to wait to see something built on the long-vacant lot. There were the countless designs that NY-based architecture firm Gluck+ showed him. “At one meeting they had 35 miniature models for us to consider,” Brown recalled. There were the many difficult meetings with neighbors and residents, who voiced concerns about obstructed views and the changing fabric of the historic neighborhood. And yes, there were complaints about that billboard. Today, there’s the Bridge. It’s an 18-story, 146-unit building that will feature high-end retailers like United by Blue, Tuna Bar restaurant, and Moxie Blue salon at the ground level, followed by apartments that range from $1,800 a month for a studio, $2,100 for a one-bedroom, to $3,100 for a two-bedroom. Fifteen of the apartments will be available for future tenants earning up to 80 percent of the area’s median income. The design of aluminum-paneled building is really a lesson in collaboration between the developer, designer, and neighborhood, says Brown. When concerns were brought up about interrupted views, Gluck+ essentially carved a piece of the building out on the fifth level, creating an expansive terrace with a cantilevered roof. The ceiling will be covered in mirrors, allowing for passersby to see the landscaped terrace from the street level. The lower half of the building, referred to as the podium, is the same height as the current structures on Race Street, while the tower rises 17 stories, set back from the street. “It conforms to its contiguous low-rise neighbors on Race Street as a solid expression of mass, then twists and ascends at 2nd Street to reflect the sky at its top,” explained principal designer Peter Gluck in a statement. The apartment units, which began pre-leasing today, are a mixed-bag—there are 36 different floor plans to choose from. But nearly every unit comes with a view, either toward Center City, overlooking Old City, or with the Benjamin Franklin Bridge right next door. Even the four units on the fourth floor that don’t have views have access to their own private terraces above the podium section of the building. Amenities include a pet-wash room off the main lobby and the fifth-floor terrace level, which is where a gym and co-working lounge are located, too. Each unit will also be able to control the temperature in their home via smartphone. At the eleventh hour, Gluck+ and Brown Hill decided to take advantage of the site’s 360-degree views and add six private terraces to the roof top. The residents of the penthouses on the 17th and 18th levels will have first dibs on renting the outdoor spaces. After 15 years, Brown is looking forward to reaching the finish line. And while the billboard is still there, and there’s still months of construction left to go, he can admit to one thing: “It’s a very unusual project,” he says “but I’ll tell you something: Philly has been a very fertile place for problem-solving.” "
Checking in on the Hanover North Broad mid-rises,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/5/14176676/hanover-north-broad-construction-photos,article,"It’s been awhile since we stopped by the site of Hanover North Broad, a mixed-use project at Broad and Callowhill that features two apartment buildings serving as a sort of gateway to the upper half of Broad Street. The project broke ground in February 2016 to much fanfare—it was four years in the making—and has already started pre-leasing its 339 apartments. As planned, the larger building on the southwest corner has progressed more quickly than its neighbor across the street. Window and paneling installations are well underway. When all is said and done, there will be 229 studio, one-, and two-bedroom units, and 11,000 square feet of retail.Across the street, the smaller apartment building still has some ways to go and is basically a shell. It will feature 110 units and 6,000 square feet of retail. According to the official website, the apartments range from $1,830 for a studio to $3,995 for a 3-bedroom, 2-bath apartment. Some of them will have walk-in closets and private balconies, too. Some of the units are expected to be move-in ready as early as February 6.

Hamilton Court renovations underway with 5 restaurants on board,https://philly.curbed.com/2017/1/5/14170394/university-city-hamilton-court-restaurants,article,"In a move that’s sure to activate a long-listless street in University City, five pretty big-time name restaurants have signed leases with Post Brothers to set up shop at the historic Hamilton Court. The developer, which has invested $250 million in the neighborhood over the past few years, announced yesterday that Bon Chon, Steve’s Prince of Steaks, Halal Guys, Tea Do, and I-CE NY have signed leases for more than 14,000 square feet of retail space on the ground level of Hamilton Court. The news comes about five months after Post Brothers announced its plans to renovate the historic Hamilton Court, which was originally a swanky hotel-turned-apartment building. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places. But for years, the streetscape along this 39th and Chestnut has been relatively inactive. Michael Pestronk, co-founder of Post Brothers, says they specifically chose to sign on these five restaurants in order to bring some life to the student-friendly neighborhood. In a statement, he said, “They will bring the public back into Hamilton Court, which was long known as one of the city’s most trafficked public venues, but has been a private building for decades.”The goal is for the restaurant tenants to move in by the end of summer 2017, before all of the college students arrive. Meanwhile, apartment renovations are currently underway. Post Brothers says the 1- to 5-bedroom(!) apartments have already been updated, although many of the original details remain: Inlaid wooden floors, ornate fireplaces(!), original beams, and exposed brick walls. They’re also in the process of converting a walled-off parking lot into an outdoor space with bocce courts, fire pits, and lounge areas. All that coupled with the 10,000-square-foot amenity facility that’s being built on the property, which will feature a fitness center, roof terrace with a pool, and yoga room.The apartment renovations and new structure will finish up in a second phase, about two years from now.

Two studios and seven 1-bedroom units are planned for the top three floors of the historic Ampere Electric Building at 2200 East Norris Street, according to this Zillow listing. The studios are available now, while the 1-bedrooms are expected to be move-in ready by February 1. Local company Ampere Capital Group is spearheading the re-development efforts of the four-story building, which dates back to the 1860s when it served as a fire station. According to public records, the property sold for $1,250,000 in 2014. Calls to the group were not answered, but according to their Facebook page, the adaptive reuse project is being called the Amperium.

Kensington warehouse converted into loft-style apartments,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/12/16/13982472/south-kensington-warehouse-adaptive-reuse-project,article,"An abandoned warehouse in South Kensington is looking better today than it has in years, thanks to the completion of an adaptive reuse project. Once a rag-turned-cabinet factory, the warehouse at 1737 Howard Street has been converted into a seven loft-style residential units. It’s the result of two local groups, Civetta Property Group and Faithful Holdings, who teamed up to rehab the graffiti-laden property in 2015. The warehouse dates back to the early 1900s when it was a rag factory. We’re told that by the 1960s it became a cabinet-making factory. By 2008, the warehouse was vacant. When Civetta and Faithful Holdings got their hands on the property, they brought on Hybrid Construction to lead the rehab. “[They] brought some amazing design ideas to the table,” says Brennan Tomasetti of Civetta Property Group. The result: A 10,000-square-foot apartment building with a new three-story addition, a bit of extra work rebuilding the second floor, and seven 1- and 2-bedroom apartments with exposed brick and industrial-sized windows. Two of the units have already been leased. The apartments range from $1,450 for this 1-bedroom to $1,995 for a 2-bedroom, 2-bath. Take a look around to see the blighted warehouse’s transformation. "

The 5 best value apartment buildings to rent in Philly,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/11/1/13486210/philadelphia-apartment-rentals-best-value,article,"Philadelphia is still a pretty affordable place to live compared to other major U.S. cities, but there’s no doubt that both buyers’ and renters’ wallets are feeling the strain of rising rents and house prices. Still, that doesn’t mean you have to live in a shoebox. For renters, there are plenty of properties in Philly that are still budget-friendly—when you consider the amenities offered and location. Take it from folks who actually live in them. VeryApt, a new website designed to make the apartment hunt easier, recently released its 2016 Renter’s Best Report and found that these are the five “best value” apartments in Philadelphia, according to the 2,500 renters who took their survey. The best value property in Philly is the Roosevelt, which is owned by Post Brothers. It features studios and 1-bedroom units starting at $1,125/month. Renters said that won’t get you much in terms in amenities—there’s only coin-operated laundry—but its location puts you right by the Schuylkill River Trail, bars, shops, and Trader Joe’s. And it should be noted: A gym, restaurant and bar, and coffee shop are in the works. With rents starting at $1,285 a month, the Chatham is the second best value property. Like the Roosevelt, it doesn’t offer much in terms of amenities, but it is right in Rittenhouse Square, next to multi-million dollar condos and homes. Plus, even the studios are spacious and some feature walk-in closets. Coming in third is another Rittenhouse Square building that’s a mix of condos and apartments. For a little more—rents start at $1,425—you can live in the heart of the city and have access to an indoor pool, gym, and even outdoor space if you’re lucky enough to snag a unit with a private balcony. Starting at just $1,105 a month, you can live in a historic building in Walnut Hill, which isn’t far from Penn. Post Brothers bought this property last year, and they’re making some upgrades to it that will include a restored lobby and gym in the future, we’ve been told. The apartments are pretty big and get lots of light, plus there’s a dog park on the grounds and retail in the works. Size may be the biggest issue here, according to renters’ reviews, but again, location is what makes the starting rent of $1,650 a good deal. It’s right in Washington Square West, and in addition to hardwood floors and new kitchen appliances, there’s in-unit laundry. "
Photos: See the impressive views from 1919 Market,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/10/17/13304038/1919-market-apartments-photos-tour,article,"There’s a lot to gawk at in 1919 Market, the 28-story tower residential tower that offers swanky amenities like a roof top pool and a wine-tasting room. But when the property officially opens in November, it may be the views that up the building’s wow factor.Developed by Brandywine Realty Trust and LCOR, 1919 Market is the latest luxury residential high-rise to open in Philly. It began construction in 2014 and began moving in residents back in March. As of this week, it’s 63 percent leased.A recent tour of the property gave Curbed Philly a sneak peek of the views from the 26th and 27th floors of the building, which will include 16 penthouses. The biggest penthouse, still under construction, clocks in at 1,458 square feet and features a wrap-around deck with views of West Philly and Center City.The penthouses are the top tier of three rental options in the building, along with the Tower Collection and City Collection. In addition to their bigger square footage, the penthouses will include three bedrooms, varied custom cabinetry, and massive, custom-built walk-in closets.The very top floor, though, is reserved for the building’s amenities and is already open to residents. It features a gym with views of the second Comcast Tower rising, a gourmet kitchen and dining room, a media room, a game simulation area, and a bar and billiards room. Still in the works is the roof top pool, which was delayed as they wait for custom 8-foot-tall glass panels to be prepped and installed. In addition, the pool is deeper than originally planned.Yet the November opening won’t keep folks from swimming—it’s designed so that the temperature can be increased up to 40 degrees warmer than the actual temperature. That will allow it to be a 3.5-season pool.Rents range from $1,770 for a studio to $3,800 and up for a 2-bedroom. The penthouses will be available for lease in the next coming weeks.

A number of rentals aren’t available until November, according to the property’s website.There are 293 units in the MV+A Architects-designed residential project, and all of them feature floor-to-ceiling windows.

But does the high monthly price tag at least rent you a lot of space?Perhaps, according to a new report that says $1,500 rents you 820 square feet of space in Philly. That’s three times as much space as in New York.RentCafe recently crunched a lot of numbers to find out how much space $1,500 rents across 100 major U.S. cities. They looked at the average price per square foot data in each city to come up with their results.Not surprisingly, Philly offers more bang for buck than New York, San Francisco, and Boston, where square footage comes at a notoriously high price. In Boston, for example, $1,500 rents just 399 square feet of space.Yet Philly is still one of the highest-priced rental markets in all of the 100 U.S. cities included. If you hover over RentCafe’s infographic, you can see just how much rents vary across the nation."

4 super last-minute rentals available during the DNC,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/7/18/12211692/democratic-national-convention-rentals,article,"It may be hard to fathom, but we are exactly one week away from the start of the Democratic National Convention. And we checked: Nearly every hotel on our essential list is all booked up. But don't fear! We’ve rounded up four super last-minute rentals still available from July 24 to 29. Like our roundup from last month, these will cost you a pretty penny, too.↑ This lovely Bella Vista Trinity-style home is new to the home rental market and is still available for the DNC. Keep in mind it only sleeps two—sorry, big groups. Also, there is no Internet, so if that’s a deal breaker for you, consider another rental on the list. This one goes for about $260 a night.↑ Someone is trying to rent out their 2-bedroom condo in the Graduate Hospital area for $750 a night. It’s been recently renovated and there’s a small but sunny deck in the back. You can also walk to Broad Street and hop on the SEPTA down to the Wells Fargo Center.↑ This 2-bedroom, 1.5-bath condo is in the heart of Rittenhouse Square, so nearly everything will be within close walking distance to you—except the actual convention site that’s down at the Wells Fargo Center. But you’re close to the subway, or you can snag a 15-minute cab ride. You’ll pay for the location, though: To stay here during the DNC will cost you $10,498 total.↑ Over in Francisville, this 3-bedroom, 3-bath home comes with an ambitious price tag of $1,500 a night. Still, it sleeps 10, so split between a big group could help soften the blow. Plus, you’ll be right on the Broad Street line—a straight shot to the Wells Fargo Center."

Falls Bridge Lofts, a residential development featuring 46 units, is currently under construction at 4328 Ridge Avenue.Last week Naked Philly passed by the construction site and noted that the developers are currently pre-leasing the apartments. According to the Falls Bridge Lofts website, the first 26 units are expected to be move-in ready by October 1, 2016. The rest of the units will be ready by December 15.The news comes just as Ridge Flats next door moves onto its next hurdle after concluding the Civic Design Review process earlier this summer. The two developments will transform this section of the Schuylkill River banks, which currently features mostly parking lots and warehouses that have sat unused for years.At the lofts, which is being developed by Overbrook Real Estate Investors, there will be more than 20 different layouts for tenants to choose from, though all of them will feature loft-style windows with views of the Schuylkill River. A letter to prospective tenants posted on the website states:Each unit comes equipped with granite countertops, stainless steel kitchen appliances (refrigerator, electric stove, dishwasher and microwave); laminate wood flooring in the living area, and designer carpet in the bedrooms.  Each unit is equipped with a dishwasher, garbage disposal, and its own washer and dryer for laundry services.There will also be amenities like a media room, a shared kitchen, a gym, bike storage room, and an area specifically for dog washing—so yes, it’s going to be a pet-friendly building.Monthly rents range from $1,400 a month for a 1-bedroom to $2,200 for a 2-bedroom with a ""high rise river view.""Calls to the property manager were not returned to Curbed Philly.

""Obviously, Fishtown is so hot now, but people are getting priced out.""So last fall when he spotted a vacant building at 3178 Richmond Street—the former Polish Army Veterans Hall—he decided to buy it.According to property records, 3178 Richmond LLC purchased it for $300,000 in September 2015.The three-story building clocks in at 7,040 square feet and features high ceilings and loft-style spaces, as well as a large marble bar, a kitchen, and hardwood floors.Metry, who is behind the adaptive reuse project at the former Salvation Army building in South Kensington, thinks the size and scale of the building makes it suitable for one main tenant, though he'd ""be open to splitting up for the right tenants.""The developer is looking to lease the space for about $6,950 a month, or less than $12 per square foot. Compare that to the going rates along Frankford Avenue, which hover somewhere around $40 per square foot, according to Metry.The building’s location on Richmond Street may help, too. It’s on the same block as the new restaurant River Wards Cafe and not far from Bait & Switch—both owned by other local developers who have seen success with developments and restaurants in Fishtown.3178+Richmond+Street+Floor+Plans "

The total cost of the renovation was $10 million.The two loft homes have already been pre-sold, but the 17 loft units are currently pre-leasing—though, they're still finalizing rental prices, Waxman says.

Presidential City, a high-rise residential community on City Avenue, is in the middle of a $100 million renovation to return its four apartment buildings to their former glory—with a splash of modern, luxurious upgrades included.A recent tour of properties with Post Brothers developer Mike Pestronk revealed modernized 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom apartments, penthouses, and a resort-style amenity center with pools, hot tubs, bocce courts, and lounge areas.It's an impressive ongoing transformation from the apartments' former pink bathroom tiles, tiny corner kitchens, and parquet flooring.""It was really nice through the 50s and 60s, but started to decline in the 70s,"" Pestronk explained. ""We bought this property at the end of its useful life and realized it couldn’t just have a lipstick renovation. It needed a full gut.""Presidential City was built in 1950 by John McShain, the ""Man Who Built Washington,"" including the Pentagon and Jefferson Memorial. McShain's intention was to build 48 residential towers that would be named after the U.S. presidents. He only managed to build the Washington, Madison, Adams, and Jefferson before he sold the rest of the land and moved on.We bought this property at the end of its useful life and realized it couldn’t just have a lipstick renovation.In 2012 the Post Brothers bought the property for $80 million, and began renovations in 2014 after they had relocated the tenants. Today, the Washington is fully rented out. The Madison is currently under construction while the other two are undergoing asbestos remediation and guts.The renovated units—ranging from $1,000 to $4,500—feature LED recessed lighting, new tilt-and-turn windows, hardwood floors, and sleek bathrooms with waterfall shower heads. The penthouses on the top six floors of the Washington have three bedrooms, two walk-in closets, and floor-to-ceiling windows.Pestronk says the bigger spaces—they clock in at about 2,600 square feet—have attracted local professional athletes from the Sixers and Phillies. ""We thought we'd get a lot of established or older adults, but we also have a bunch of professional athletes who don't necessarily care about going out in Rittenhouse,"" says Pestronk, ""Plus, these penthouses are big and spacious, and they're big guys.""But perhaps the development's most impressive makeover is its amenity center and pools, which features a fitness center, spa rooms, a juice bar, and saunas. (This doesn't include the smaller cardio gyms found in each apartment building.)

""It's designed to feel like a Southeast Asian resort,"" says Pestronk. Three pools—a play pool, lounge pool, and lap pool—take up the center of the amenity area and will open in April. There are two bocce courts to the side, two gourmet kitchens and dining areas, and cabanas.Next on the agenda for the Post Brothers is renovating the seven properties they recently bought in University City.

Report Reveals Philly's Rent isFinallyon the Rise,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/3/14/11219398/philly-average-rent-increase-report,article,"After months of experiencing dwindling rental prices in Philly, a new report has found that the city experienced a slight increase in median rents last month.The median rent of 1-bedroom apartments in Philadelphia jumped 2.5 percent in February, according to Zumper's latest monthly report. Rents for 2-bedroom units increased by 2.2 percent.Last month, the average rental price for a 1-bedroom unit was $1,230 a month; for a 2-bedroom unit it was $1,380.The slight bump pushes Philadelphia up one spot to the 15th most expensive rental market in the U.S., tied with Denver.Is this a sign of things to come? Potentially, given the city's hot apartment-housing stock. Just take solace in the fact that our numbers are nowhere near those in San Francisco, which experienced a similar 2.6 percent increase for one-bedroom apartments—only the median rent there is $3,590."

Check Out The Ben's Transformation,https://philly.curbed.com/2016/2/25/11112754/historic-aka-washington-square-renovations-update,article,"AKA Washington Square, the historic building on Chestnut Street that's become known for its role in Silver Linings Playbook, is currently in the middle of a multi-million dollar renovation. And even with the $20 million already put into the project, it'll be another $6 million and a few more years before the owners can say that building has been restored to its former glory.Formerly known as the Ben Franklin Hotel or ""The Ben,"" the building at 834 Chestnut Street was designed by Horace Traumbauer in 1925 and at one point served as the largest hotel in the city. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Over the years, it served as a residential building and medical office space, with the grand lobby serving mostly as a bus terminal.At least, that's how Brad Korman, co-CEO of Korman Associates, describes it. ""When we bought this property in mid-2011, there hadn’t been any care as to who could use the space. There were residences, medical offices—this lobby felt like bus terminal with people coming and going.""""It was basically like 30th Street Station,"" added co-CEO Larry Korman.Since the Kormans have had the keys, they've put $20 million into restoring the historic property to its original state. Working with a team of architects, designers, and historical preservationists, they got rid of the blue and yellow paint on the ceilings. They separated the commercial from residential and added a number of amenities to the AKA residences. And they replaced the lobby fountain and upgraded the aging elevators.

But they're still not finished. Another $6 to $8 million will be spent in the next two years on more renovations, including work on the grand ballroom that was featured in the Silver Linings Playbook.In addition, a restaurant will be opening in mid-May and a terrace upstairs will serve as a tea room for residents. (Fun fact: Before the Ben was built, the Continental Hotel stood on this site. Abraham Lincoln gave his pre-inaugural address where the tea terrace is now located.)""Our goal is to do whatever we feel we need to do to keep the property maintained, but enhanced,"" says Larry.For now, both residents and the public can enjoy drinks in the lobby while listening to live music Tuesdays through Saturdays. Eddie Bruce has been tapped as the musical director of AKA Washington Square.""It's taken years, and it's frustrating, but it's a historic landmark,"" says Brad. ""We're willing to do this the right way.""

Craigslist Apartment Listings Imagined as Billboards,https://philly.curbed.com/2015/6/8/9952362/craigslist-apartment-listings-billboards-philadelphia,article,"Driving into the city on I-95, just before the exit for 676, a steadily-rotating collection of Visit Philly billboards welcomes visitors to the city. ""Run the steps like nobody's watching,"" reads one, accompanied by a black-and-white photo of a dancer in mid-leap at the top of the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. ""There's no jawn like home,"" reads another, a sunset photo of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge floating above the visitor's bureau's cutesy ""With Love, Philadelphia xoxo signature along the bottom."" Visit Philly recently held a contest for residents of Philadelphia to create their own billboard to shuffle into the rotation, and although the winner has already been selected, you can still create-your-own 'billboard' on the Write-A-Billboard app, to share with friends and family on social media (albeit on a slightly smaller scale). Just because Renters Week has gone by doesn't mean we can't have a little fun and give old buddy Craigslist the billboard treatment, using the actual listing photos and accompanying text as fodder for what very well might make some fun additions to that little stretch of 95. Here's what around $2,000 rents you in Philly. On Craigslist. As billboards.
